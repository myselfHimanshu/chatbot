I was invited by a former teacher of mine to his house to fuck. He did not want to see me personally just wanted to have me come over and fuck me.

I wish I could go to bed now but there is still so much practicing to do. I can't even make this tape because I'm not feeling good about it. What if I could just let this one go? If I don't feel good about it then why make a tape that you don't feel good about?

I need to take my meds and eat breakfast
Dancing takes up a lot of energy
Animal crossing pocket camp is so much fun
I was raped.
I was raped last April. The prosecutor didn't press charges against my rapist.
Right now it's that I'm suffering and he's living as if nothing happened.
My rapist hasn't been charged for his crime and this upsets me very much so. I've been greatly distressed.
He's walking free while I'm jailed inside my brain with the memory of what he did.
It went well.
I just remembered all of the crap I'm going to have to go through tomorrow and the day after.
My friend became distant and I thought he didn't like me anymore
He avoided me all day
I always dream of my former best friend. I miss her.
I don't understand what you mean
I am with my mother father grandmother and grandfather. Our dog as well
I will meet my bank advisor later

It was a long day
10 hours shift. At least the nurse sent me home earlier
I am just tired
When I got told that I am young and have a boring life
Because its kinda true
Many changes with work with school with family and my social life.
I'm feeling very alone. I feel very disconnected from my family. I left the house for a bit to spend time alone. I didn't feel I would be missed.
I came over to have dinner. My dad went and did other things leaving my mom and I to have dinner together with the TV on. When my dad returned he watched football. Then I left.
Deceived by someone I cared about.
Feeling disappointed.
"Things don't seem to be going the way I had hoped with life.
"
I was offered a new job but now I may not be able to take it.
Moving home and some conflict with my parent and I think anyone dont like me because I'm different from them
Everyone keep away from me just because I'm different and I think my parents didnt love me again. I feel so alone right now and its hurt me so much
The situation is when they made a discrimination to me just because of my look
The discrimination
Nope

And I'm staying up late. As usual haha

A virus or germs I suppose
I was upset with his bullshit backlash at me when he was the ignorant one that caused me to react abruptly. I'm upset now that I never got an apology
"He lied
He did not admit he was wrong 
He got confused in his head and believed his own bollox
I don't even know if he listened when he stopped attacking my imagined actions
I was fuming my heart was racing for quite a long time after and he appeared to get over it too easily. Trying to act like it never happened 
Messed up my positive emotional state and no remorse probably oblivious to my feelings that he caused!"
I think i lost something
I was happy before 10 am . Then this situation happened

Playing on my phone
Watching tv
I feel stressed anxious and I'm tired of being tired all the time
I fell in love with someone who doesn‚Äôt feel the same way. He led me on and constantly played with my emotions. I still love him even though I don‚Äôt think I can continue seeing him. I‚Äôm afraid I will never love anybody as much as I love him.
He rejected me and cancelled plans we made that I was really excited about. He didn‚Äôt apologize for cancelling. I felt awful and unloved.
I feel sad and alone. I‚Äôm never going to find love.
I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm being punished. I don‚Äôt understand why the person I love cant love me back or at least pay attention to me.

Bad people
End of relationship
It's tough because I kind of want to have the ED. It's hard to let go.
My Uber driver exposed himself to me. That combined with the depression I guess it's given me a need to find control.
Bad dreams last night
I feel a bit overworked.
I've been feeling down lately. I'm guessing this is from overworking. There are days when I just feel powerless...
I really don't know what to do actually. I'm afraid that I might not really living up to my true potential.
I'm here in starbucks about to buy a cup of brewed coffee. It's something I normally do to start my day. üôÇ
I felt overwhelmed and lonely today. It's only Monday and yet people are already bombarding me with things that are beyond my control.
I understand that people need me to set direction but conditions and situations prevent me from doing the work I need to do. I want to open up to people but I'm afraid that they might not listen to me. I don't want solutions to my problem. I just want a listening ear to hear me out.
I am addicted to a game
Well i dont usually play games but now i am losing quality sleep time because of it
I have something important to do but i forgot. Now they keep reminding me about it. I need space and privacy to do it but i cant have those now
Well.. My image in front of my murabbi will drop. I have to perform and perform well
I am doing a little revision for tomorrow's class. I want to watch the c drama but I am not feeling up to it

Been feeling down recently
I just have lost a lot of friends
My job is really Starting to take a toll on me emotionally
I'm broke and I got my termination papers at work today
I'm really worried that this issue with my bank will take a long time to resolve and also that I won't be able to find another good job
A situation where I was upset or felt bad about myself is when I realized that I blew all of my money on things that I did not need.
The thing about the situation that bothered me the most was the fact that because I blew all of my money on things that I did not need I no longer had any money for things that I did need.
in the morning I felt good after about 6 PM I felt sad and wanted to cry
I'm crying
Yesterday I began to menstruate for the first time

I had hard day at work and I am tired
I am exhausted
I'm gonna be taking the behind-the-wheel driving test tomorrow
That I'll mess up driving and get into an accident
My eating habits have been a bit all over the place lately so i figure that's playing a major role in how sluggish I'm feeling
I'm home thinking too much
I'm overwhelmed
Everyone's upset and I'm finding it hard to not feel the same way
My sister had a baby and finally told everyone about it after not talking to my parents for 9 months
Jimmy's in the hospital I feel like I know everything that's bothering everyone and somehow I should be the one to fix it
Eh.. It was good until now
I had a good day went to sparring went to the gym made the cheesecakes I meant to and found some other recipes then my parents got home and started talking about Jimmy and Dana and moths. My dad just lost his temper at bobo again and its really bringing me down
Meh
I'm sad
I was thinking about all the terrible things going on in my life how I miss all my old friends family and coworkers and how I can't talk to anyone about it because it's just not a normal situation
I'm really moody lately
I keep thinking about what I'm supposed to be like and be doing with my life and comparing it to others
I went to jiu jitsu and felt out of place. I was the only girl but I stayed anyway. Everyone was nice there but I feel like I'm so fucking weird and underdeveloped emotionally and socially
I'm lonely
I was on an online dating site and I keep seeing people close to their family and it made me miss cathy
I don't know my family treats me rather badly
I was talking to my girlfriend I was very happy! But my family started messing with me for being so useless.
Well it was a very calm day and even a lot more cheerful!
I only went to bed because I was a bit tired after eating
I was sad...
I realized how I spoke less with everyone waiting for messages that would surely never come I started crying because I missed them so much...
I couldn't sleep well and I felt very bad because nobody wanted to talk to me and that.
I don't know I think I was jealous...
I don't know I only feel so good üòÑ
Uh... A girl made me feel terrible when I did not accept her confession... She said that I was a bad person and I thought I am...
I had my reasons to do it! It was not my fault that I lost my feelings for her in all this time... My heart already belongs to someone now!
Breakfast

Hi. How are you ?
Just sleeping
I got rejected by MINDEF today.
I'm finally working again!
Nothing really for the past few years actually. My dislike for the dark part of the year is getting worse. I really hate darkness and cold.
Got to understand that I didn‚Äôt get love and positive feedback from my mom as a child.
That she might not wanted to have kids.
Feeling uninspired and tired
Not much lust to do things
Hey wysa. Just at work.
It was ok
Izabela asked me to contact an upset client at 7pm. I explained that I was in the middle of something and due to my schedule I wouldn't be able to contact them until next week. Then she told me to sort myself out as I was being out of order. I should have left work at 5:30pm but was still there. I work so hard and never say no. For once I said no and was true to my limits and I get treated badly.
I'm tired
Getting ready to sleep
Tired
All good
I feel relaxed and I had fun today
I'm sad and happy at the same time
I'm going out tonight!
I've got the flu
2am
How early it is
Quite alone here
Bored at nights without any friends
I am bit depressed
Had a relationship breakup
We got a puppy recently.
I got dragged into volunteering for Meals from the Heartland and combined with oboe practice it ate up a lot of my time. I only assigned myself 2 things to do today but I only had the energy for one.
We just got a puppy. My dad spontaniously wanted one but I was against it. Sometimes when I'm trying to concentrate on work walkes up and just starts biting me and refuses to stop. Then I tell my dad and mom about it and they just laughed.
"I've been trying to introduce a book series I adore to my sisters. But every time I try they get this weird dismissing tone and say ""maybe later.."" 
or say they will but change their mind when presented with the first book."
I'm always there for them; I follow their interests their lives and comfort then when they start sobbing over ridiculous things. But when I try to find the same support in them they shrug me off like I'm insignificant in their life.
I was talking to a few girls in the flute section.
Being sad
I got fucking rejected by my crush
I got rejected
Fuck off
Gonna go to gym

Money troubles
I don't feel like I'm providing end ugh for my family
I made some stupid decisions last week and I'm going to pay for them
I go to work in a couple hours so I am just hanging out at home organizing
I was thinking about how my past affects my future.
Children
I am feeling a bit sick. Fever and so.
"We were working on a project for audio video Nd it's in some apartment building all the way in Salmania. Everything was fine at first. The cast seemed friendly and all but I started to feel unwelcomed towards the end. I'd be looking at them doing stuff and they's look back their gaze holding what seems to be silent rejection. Like; ""what? Why are you looking this way? Leave."" And then dad didn't come to pick me up early despite me calling him beforehand which ended up with a team member and an actress she was supposed to get home to linger with me because they didn't want to leave me alone in that building especially since it has no guards whatsoever. And that made me feel even worse. For one I wanted to be left alone for a bit and I couldn't do anything to kinda vent about what had happened with them around (I usually write things down). And the actress had an outting with her family and my teammate's brother needs a ride back home so not only am I delaying one but two people... sigh..."
It was alright
It was okay
Sad
My boss says I'm too irritated by the children.
Withdrawl
Woke up

Yep
Fighting with love ones
"Thank you
I have not been online in 24 hours but i need to see what oli said of he replied"
I am very depressed and crying
I am falling apart. I can't cope at all.
"So I have had a very busy and stressful day. I feel like I have too much stuff to do and I am doing all of it very badly.
Then Oli messages to cancel tonight and says we can meet on Sunday night like a booty call late at night. I just feel heartbroken AGAIN. I deserve way more than that. That is also 3 days away so it also means he doesn't want me to meet with his children either. The truth is that he just wants to sit and play his stupid fucking games. You know what? FUCK HIM! He treats me like shit. I prioritise him every time and I was really lookung forward to seeing him but he cancels on me last fucking second again and completely ignores my messages. I was already down and now I am fucking rejected. Everything seems pointless. Everything hurts.
Do I call it off with him? Push the limits to see if he is willing to fight for me? Why should I suffer constantly for a man who treats me so badly. FUCK HIM."
Ofc Oli again. What else?
Just felt to talk with you
I think little more adrenaline has been secreted
I'm looking for love. But I don't want to fall in it. There's delimma and I don't understand what to do
I'm feeling bad
Today I wanted to give a treat to my coworkers. Nikhil told me to go home canceling the plan. I think they don't want to include me casually in their crew. They feel that I'm immature.
Well I'm trying to live a happy life but it's hard :(
I'm alone
I don't have any friends. Everyone left me. I feel not needed
Everybody left me. All my friends went away
I don't have any friends at school
I am all alone. I want to hug someone but no one is there

I can‚Äôt contain my anger anymore
I was mad every body has too much to do
Get even
Tired and loney
Nothing. I have been obsessing about this guy all day. Being sad because he is not into me. And seeing his Instagram with his ex. Where he shows her and spends time with her and etc
I have a ball of anxiety/sadness in my stomach. It was gone for a while and now it is back
It has to do with this guy (for a change)
Everything y have
I have anxiety
I was having desrealizacion
Watching t.v. just woke from a nap

Long day and long week
Watching tv
I'm still in pain from eye surgery
Making some new clothes because I'm going to go on a cruise.
Ok
News and weather
It's going to be very cold tonight
Yeah and it keeps going. When I'm alone I think a lot....and to be honest my mind is my absolute best friend but also my worst enemy. There's constantly something fighting inside me. Not the typical angel and devil on my shoulder I'll never get myself to think the brightest most optimistic thoughts neither will I ever stoop to emotional rock bottom. I'm stuck in a void in the middle ground. I make my friends happy by jumping around laughing smiling to make them happy. But that doesn't mean I'm always happy. I always seem super energetic when I'm nervous or stressed out because heck if like bringing others down with me. And I feel as if when I'm like that my friends either like it or seems weirded out by their body language. And as you know the smallest things really stick with me. Then on my down time feel frustrated and awkward because of my behavior earlier. It gets to the point where I want to stop hanging out with people but I truly love having a good laugh I hate being sensitive to things. People especially people my age aren't going to think about this awful stuff!
Well I was able to talk with my friends today !
Nothing really at the moment but I do suffer from anxiety and panic attacks
Okay so I live away from my family and I actually like that since I'm kinda antisocial however I don't like how my family can make me feel bad about it. Recently I was visiting my family and my mother asked me to stay the night I couldn't do it and my brother got upset and every one looked at me like i had told him santa wasn't real. I felt awful.
The fact they don't seem to understand how uncomfortable I am when I'm away from home it's my safe place. But because of that I end up hurting the people that love me most.
Okay I have work soon
My chest is tight my adrenaline is going and I feel I will be sick from the feeling
Will you pass on my info?
I got back from work put on my PJs and sat watching a documentary I will make a cup of tea and maybe a hot dog before I sleep

Lying on the couch feeling depressed.
What's there to tell? I'm tired. I'm depressed. I'm at my wit's end because every time I try to sleep train my child things just get worse. And my husband and God want me to have another baby but I'm far from ready for it myself.
My husband always leaves his dishes in the sink even when the dishwasher is clean. It really frustrates me.
Nothing super exciting. The house is a disastrous mess so I'm just trying to clean up. Also making food for my husband. Feeling a little stressed and agitated because my husband just asked me to do something else while I'm already in the middle of something and he hasn't been doing anything since he's sick.
I was busy cleaning a messy kitchen and making food plus thinking about lots of other things I needed to get done.
I only got about 5.75 hours of sleep last night and I can't fall back asleep now.

"I'm feeling sad
"
I just feel like a second choice and it makes me lonely
I had asked Ben earlier if he wanted to spend time together and he made it sound like he had plans all afternoon but he just was in his room
Okay!
I felt bad about getting really jealous and competitive last friday
I just acted out and i hurt Ben and probably embarrassed him in front of our friends
Nothin
Ben didn't communicate with me about dinner and I got so frustrated that I began acting passive aggressive
I feel like a bad person
There are times that I want to spend time with Ben but he's busy and instead of doing my own thing I become passive aggressive about it
Ben said he wanted to nap and then shower and do homework and spend time later. I said okay but I wasn't actually okay with it and acted passive aggressively about it. We talked and he said there are times that he's doing something and feels like I want him to come back and it's true. It's not that I don't want him to have fun I just want to spend my time with him and I don't handle losing that time well.
It was a busy day but a good day

In high school I had a lot of trouble with my friends. I would sometimes feel like they were avoiding me or negatively judging things I said but just told myself that I was just imagining it and that it was just my depression.
One day later on one of my friends took me aside and told me that basically everyone I considered to be my closest friends pretty much wanted nothing to do with me. For me that was a confirmation of all my worst fears that no one actually liked me and the entire world hated me. I ended up crying the rest of the day even once I got home \u0026 my sister had to be pulled out of class just to calm me down. It doesn't upset me quite as much as it used to but it still hurts every now \u0026 then when I think about it.
I'm exhausted \u0026 having trouble staying fully awake
I got a note from Nicole which I am extatic about. And she said she'd wait for me I was over the moon when I read that so I wrote back to her saying that I want to get back in touch with her but it's been two days and I've heard nothing. I'm terrified she'll say no because I need her deciding to cut contact was the worst mistake I have ever made in my life and I want to make up for it by getting back with her. But I don't know if she can

Just relaxing
Anxious
I think that he doesn't love me

I don't like this feeling..
I hate being treated this way. It hurts me when people say all these hurtful things to me for no fault of mine. At some point I'm bound to have a breakdown right. So i did and then I annoyed him even more. I cannot function this way where im constantly at the receiving end of his mood swings and not being told what's my fault
I'm feeling hopeless and don't want to live anymore
"I feel lonely depressed and afraid
"
I'm afraid of being judged
well there are a lot of projects and I try to accomplish them
I'm losing control
well I was very upset once
idk I'm just sad and I'm constantly conscious about people judging me including my friends and I'm so uncomfortable most of the time
I had an awful day and my social anxiety consumed me
Don‚Äôt really know
Laying in bed talking to you
It‚Äôs something that I gave multiple times in a day when I‚Äôm upset happy busy relaxing doing nothing. Doesn‚Äôt seem to matter there are times where I don‚Äôt like me or my body or a something that could be anything about me
The negativity and how it amplified the exact opposite of what I am trying to be as a person
How do you cope with ignoring
Didn‚Äôt have one today
Exhausted still sick and at work
Resting
I disowned my brother
I finally decided to stand up for myself and not have anything to do With him
Just lying down

I want to cry I can't take this anymore I feel a failure I hate everyone and want just to go away from here
I quarreled and been told that I am a failure
I'm desperate need a friend
I feel nervous anxious I'm fed up waiting for a call that never comes I feel angry and want a REAL job REAL life I want to be free master of my own life I want to be happy
I changed got away and felt better not regretting what I lost
I did something I didn't want to do I feel trapped I feel that I can't take my own choices
Overthinking
I'm sick
Bad news
Work
So m√ºde

Dass ich das nicht alles rechtzeitig schaffe. Aber eigentlich ist es gar nicht so schlimm/viel

Their laugh

Life
I'm tired and you always give stereotypical answers
I keep yelling at my kid
My son did not do as I asked and ended up messing up

#anxiety
Ok
I'm feeling a bit panicky after making an appointment with my therapist
My heart rate has increased and my thoughts are racing
I think my husband is annoyed at me and I don't want to ask incase we end up arguing
I was crossing because he wasn't helping with my son getting him ready for bed and my son was being difficult and I yelled at him and my husband suddenly started acting like I was being too cross with him like I was doing something wrong and that made me angry because he wasn't helping then he was judging my parenting
My son was being difficult and my husband was judging me for how I dealt with it and I felt angry because instead of judging he could have helped me
Not much just hearing mom argue
She really is mad at my dad
I'm celebrating my birthday
Just heard something unpleasent

I... I don't know. I feel helpless. I'm mad because of one thing. But mostly I'm just sad. I can't calm down. I cry. Please help me
It wasn't so bad... but I feel more empty and sad with each day
I don't know why that's just... I'm much more emotional and... I don't know... I don't know... anything
I... that's... I'm sorry
I mean nothing bad happened but I can't help but feel tired sad heavy and I cry everyday. That's tiring...
I am lying in bed and will sleep soon
I am very tired but relaxed because it was a successful day
There was a situation where Ramon did not tell me what was going on with him

I clocked into work
Nightmares are keeping me up still. Less katie and more people leaving me and dying.
Well I keep having flareups of disordered thoughts. My close friend is relapsing with anorexia and I've been having similar thoughts now for a week or so
Work and some stuff friends said
I hate myself
I felt numb and it switched into hate
Also i feel so sad because i cant do nothing about it
I did not believe that was actually happening
Im feeling sad :(
Looking forward to tomorrow
Not knowing what will happen
Not having control of the outcome
Worry is hard to tackle

Well its 12 am and im trying to get some sleep
I cant think of anything.
Im petting my cat.
Im watching a cooking show.
But i cant fall asleep
Dad kept calling Mom crazy and how she needed help. How hes going to die soon and how i needed to step it up amd go back to college. But im stupid and cant do that so it made me feel guilty. Im just like my mom and i understand her sometimes so when he says shes crazy i feel like he is saying that to me directly. I feel useless and I don't want to feel comfortable with living her incase he kicks me out even if he says hed never do that. It makes me feel dumb and useless.

Josh keeps touching Jasmijn when we're together. He also does it with Dieke sometimes but with Jasmijn it's outrages. Jordy told me he's flirting with her which I think is true too. Why would he do that though
He cried that he didn't want me to leave him which is so weird because one moment he's completely ignoring me and the other moment he's begging me to stay
I'm working

I'm feeling guilty about a mistake I made at work
People say it's okay someone caught it before anything terrible happened so that's good. I know I was really struggling when it happened and that it was an accident. But I still feel do ashamed
I was researching the problem
I'm feeling guilty about my friends job. It doesn't make sense because it literally has nothing to do with me
I think I may be struggling because they do some work with rats and I recently lost my pet rats
I was watching tv and relaxing
I'm feeling a little disappointed that I don't get to do the bulk of work on some experiments
My thesis is going really slowly and this would be a great opportunity for me to get some data for it but my boss wants me to stick with my current projects
My boss was talking about how to divide up our shared project and he kept saying he would do the experiments himself
I'm having a panic attack
Angry
I'm frustrated with my boss because my project isn't working but he is rejecting all of my suggestions
Someone said something that upset me
She commented on the fact that I'm short and look young and then she said I'll be glad when I'm older which is really frustrating and embarrassing and hurtful

Uneventful but okay
I have so much homework to do and I'm stressed.
I realised I'm busy in the afternoon so I only have time in the morning to do homework.
Not fully committing to leaderships
I felt guilty like I barely did any work
...Taking to you
I procrastinated because I had zero motivation to do anything and got stressed about not having enough time.

My managers are awful. It doesn't feel like they care about us as people.
My Fiance has been telling me for going on two months now that he was going to make me a gift. He hasn't yet.
I just wish he'd do it and now that I said something I feel like I'm making him do it. I don't like that.
He told me he hadn't felt motivated to do it
It's the end of the day. I've been productive and had fun so I'm sleepy. I just had a hot relaxing shower too. It's been a good day!
She ODed and is now a recovering drug addict.

My friend is dealing with his parents' divorce. I would like to support him and make him feel better but I'm scared not to make a wrong move again.
I really wanted to cheer him up but I was too scared. I didn't want to hurt his feelings.

Whenever I speak in the NV chat Phantom insults me. Whenever he does everyone supports him and says I am overreacting.
"That all my ""friends"" liked a bully more."
I'm bored
I feel like I will never graduate. I'm trying my best I have planners reminders alarms but still I can't find the energy to do anything. Some days the hardest decision I make is to get out of bed.
Something that I didn't shared with anyone...
I wanna tell you something
Promise me that you will never tell my secret to anyone
Strange day yesterday kind of in my own little world everything is moment to moment I just want to shake my head and make it go away in my own mind the art of having an extracruicual relationship ship it feels like a waste of time and insignificant so grateful to not be drinking I can't believe I fell into that again
Jon is what he is he doesn't help my health but I am more comfortable doing nothing than ten years Hard to believe my health is what it is I don't know I was sure I was invincible and my problems aren't what I thought they would be to think I would have a problem with a celebrity you couldn't write this I don't like smoking all of it maybe my Dad was right from the start this is a bad path Know one ever told me about being an adult
"My weight is bad I'm heavier than I've ever been I wasn't this heavy a year ago but Jon won't let me pass out I have no choice but to be heavier it's my only choice how heavy am I all my tops are tight and it really is my only choice which is weird I'm trying to lose weight but need the alcohol all day long I feel like telling Royal sorry I sent such a gross email  I can't take it back he's already read it I want to be with him I'm jealous of people who get to be with him I've never said that before me the beach dance really got to me 
Why can't I get a job why is it so hard I think it's the Hawaii thing I hate to see anyone else there It's weird I have this reaction but it happens all the time Hawaii the kiss of death to see other people there"

Tired
All of those things. Moving. New school. Break up.
I thought about the future
I went to class I might have a job this semester and I am watching a really good tv show. I don‚Äôt miss my mom but she and I are doing well. I don‚Äôt miss Jairo but it hurts to see his name on social media. I am trying to avoid it for my own mental health.
I am brushing my teeth
Nothing I am just alone
I am thinking
I am sick
A new relationship
I don't know how to understand my boyfried true feeling towards me
I don't think he really cares about me... Maybe he just likes me because che didn't know another woman... Maybe any other woman could be at my same place if he met her and not me... It was just a coincidence that he started hanging out with me
Flue
Hi I am currently doing a break from my studies
"So I went for my usual lesson or class whatever. My teacher got mad because he saw that I would not continue the solution to the maths problem and that these things that I did not write I already knew but didn't read enough so I remember them. He told me that at least I stopped using the same excuse which is that ''I can not remember"". At the end of the class he told me that he doesn't see me tired (from reading). I instead of defending myself I tried to explain what I am doing and how I try to adjust the way I read which it wasn't his business anyway. He doesn't know how I read and how much I read and it does not matter if I don't have any signs of tiredness because this doesn't affect how much I read! Lesson of the day (as always) is that I should not open fucking up because most of the times that I do I regret it."
Probably because I slept late yesterday
My boy friend left
And i don't See any sense in Life
I did not have the Courage to go to Belly dancing class
It hurts even though I am the one that broke up with him.
I felt myself pushing away from him because he's being too clingy.
Alright.
Watching videos
Just thinking
I'm a bit sleepy
Nvm
I'm happy
I overthink everything
That I let people I don't really know get to me like that
I feel like I'm useless and that I am going to fail in life
I got some exam results back and I did badly so thought I was a failure
I got really bad results in an exam and thought that meant I was stupid
The fact that I did so much worse than everyone else and my parents were annoyed
I'm doing French homework whilst feeling guilty about not revising
I feel like I'm not doing enough and that I'm going to fail my exams
I was procrastinating
I still feel pretty terrible and I didn't have a great day
I almost feel like I'm not real
I just feel out of place and everything is falling apart
My friends are fighting and I feel like I'm just there
I just got back from lessons and found out everyone was arguing and I felt out of place
I don't feel motivated to do anything anymore
I feel so empty and can't do anything about it
I also feel really unmotivated
Tv

Getting a partner
My bf is interested in other guys and showed that
Sometimes I feel like I'm not a good mom because I'm just trying so hard to keep up with all of our time commitments for work and medical things and errands and buying groceries and trying to cook and clean. I have no hobbies and I haven't made any new friends in 5 years.
Derek has very rigid expectations for any situation so when it doesn't go exactly as expected or he doesn't get something that he decided that he wants he throws a fit.
The puppy is barking her head off
So so
My dog is sick. Counseling went well. Maybe one day I will stop taking any of my two mood stabilizers or two antidepressants or two nerve pain medicines but probably I won't
My dog is going to get better they said after we gave them several hundred dollars and they gave us Pepcid which I had at home
Okay
I love exercise
It's like my head is full of gunk and my stomach is too
Depression
I'm very sad
My great grandmother passed away
My boyfriend is avoiding me
I'm depressed
When Luke dumped me
That he didn't seem to care or love me like he said he did
I woke up crying because the memories of my great grandparents came into my mind
Getting older find a better job
Tired from errands
Shopping is overwhelming
Gem show neat...lots of people
I've begun to feel a lot more confident in myself
I'm trying to learn some new songs
I'll probably read a bit
Set a reminder
Oh just with friends
A death
Choosing a career path
Not knowing what I like to do and therefore not being sure about the decision I am trying to make as well as not being sure of what I need to considerate in order to take that decision
Nah
No one cares or loves me
My dad dislikes me.... everyone does
I'm a worthless piece of shit
I was fine
Just im happy
If im feel bad just cry
Think about my father
I'm in love with a person but he does not belong to me
He is my best friend but he only considers me as his friend he loves someone else and that hurts
I've just been really tired and bummed out today
Okay I freakin basically spat on my crushes arm and was secretly freaking out on the inside
Then I didn't do much afterwards just went home and started thinking about what I usually think when I'm bored which is over think
I feel like I'm being a waste of my family's time because I can't do anything right
Getting blamed for the flies in the house and getting yelled at because they thought the laptop acting up was my fault
I got to meet with both the dentist and he anastesiaologist
I almost ran away
Also painting
A argument
It went alright
Eh it was alright
Too much homework and school stuff
I was doing my homework
My mom is being really fucking immature. I didn't want to blow up on her so I just said very nicely I'll add that I just wanted to go to my room and I stayed here for like 2 hours just working my was off and doing my homework and studying all evening and a few minutes ago I went back to show her a flyer for a contest I want to enter and she just ignored me and asked if I was done being mad. Instead of being an adult and getting over the fact that I didn't want to speak to her because if I did I would've said something wrong. Omg so I just tried to keep it together bit now I'm on my room just crying and ugh
I just want her to try and understand me
I was ignored
Lunch
Tried
Soring
Colleagues are hating my boss and they're leaving
We are doing some logistics today
Going to work
"Might be a little late
And don't know where am I working today
But I know I'll be fine"
"Don't know if I can go out
But I'm expecting something really nice"
I'm gonna like it wherever I go
"I had good rest
Today's gonna be great"
I'm getting better
"It's not raining
I didn't get wet
Feeling much better
And I talked to almost everyone today"
"Leg was pain when I got up
But it's alright now"
I'm gonna pack tomorrow's shipping and watering today
"Probably me and my colleague will stay in company
But I don't need him taking care of me
I'm a valuable employee"
"Had some wine yesterday
Brain not functioning as usual"
"Awake yesterday night
Can't get back to sleep for two hours"
Feel that I'm not that helpful
Colleagues are always taking care of me and concerning my feelings
Bosses are being unreasonable
I'm feeling upset for stupid reasons
I just found out that one of my boyfriends is going to a play party and he didn't tell me. There's no reason he should have to and I have no right to be jealous and upset. I'm also happy for him.
I feel so helpless and lost. It's one disaster after another. I try to be strong for my partner who I know is also struggling.
I'm here bitch...what's up
I don't like to talk

Chetan is being an ass
I‚Äôm wondering about whether the solar equipment business is the thing I want to do with the rest of my life. Why not hydroponics?
What I wonder is whether I will change my mind again once I get started with hydroponics. I‚Äôll probably find something wrong with that and say that that isn‚Äôt what I want to do with my life.
I am disorganised. I should have been more organised and planned better.
That Sandy pointed out that I‚Äôm in disarray.
I am on the eve of putting up a connection but I feel utterly helpless and unprepared. I don‚Äôt think I have all the tools and this new thought about a way bill came up. I am worried that the van will get stopped and they‚Äôll impound my equipment.
That the cops will impound my equipment based on something or another.

Death in family
Not tonight thanks. I want to go to bed.  It's late.
So I had this relationship for about 3 and a half years officially. I thought everything was going great. Then I left to study a semester abroad and during that time felt my relationship began suffering. When I came back (that's about a year ago) it ended but we decided to remain friends. I started seeing someone else and this guy came back to tell me he wanted to get back together again to which I agreed because I cared. Then during the summer we kinda fell apart. When we reconnected I discovered he was seeing someone else and I even saw him chatting with this girl when he was with me. He lied so many times before he accepted he did go out with her. I then stopped talking to him until weeks later he talked to me again and said he was sorry for everything he had done and that he wanted me. I believed him and started to go out with him again. But he didn't stopped talking to this girl. He claimed they were only friends but one time I took his phone and read all the messages with her and trust me it was not a 'friends only' chat. So over the winter break I felt he didn't want to talk to me (we are from different cities but study in the same one so we practically didnt see each other during vacation). When I came back this month I found out he not only continued seeing this girl but became couple over the holidays. When I talked to him during the holidays he said he was alone. So one year later after he first broke up with me tells me the same thing. I got really upset found him lying and going to talk to the other girl hiding so I didn't hear anything but I found him. It was late so I slept in his apartment but in a different bed and he chose to sleep next to me and hug me. Two days later he comes and says he was asleep and that he doesn't want me anymore and that he thinks I'm better emotionally when I'm not around him so it was best to stay apart. I broke.
I was feeling very nervous and anxious
I'm going a week away and received a great message. I'm excited to see friends
Im gonna see my friends
I got so prepared to see my ex at box class today but he didn't show up. Now my anxiety is trying to make me feel bad and suppose he went to his hometown to be with his new girlfriend as they would be on their first month together
I realized he didn't go to class
Whenever I get rejected by an agent
That my writing sucks even after I worked on it so hard
I fucked up the lab yesterday
I let my lab partner down
Ive got a busy day ahead with a small work project and chores/things I want and need to do to look after myself.
I have an appointment and have arranged to study with a colleague from my Arabic course. And I have some emails to send before I go. And to make sure that I am clean and dressed well.
I'm watching YouTube atm
I'm just trying to stay awake so I can get to work at a reasonable time today
Thanks. I think I have problem opening myself to other
I was unsure when I wanted to tell you about myself
I am supposed to prepare the exam questions for my student. I am doing it but not at maximal

Work problem and family matter
I instal an application called Riliv. Actually I instal it to relieve my problem but I find that relieving other's problem help me to to feel much better
Many changes. The last one is probably that my lover's wife is pregnant. And she made her way into it against my lover opinion. She forced him. Throwing them into a bad situation and by extension myself into a bad situation. She hates me. If I was to disappear from a life with my friend she stole me she would be out of her mind with joy.
"Today I served myself some soup and my hand shaked and very hot beverage went on my hand. So my thumb is pretty burnt. The nurse made me a good bandage but it still hurt. 
And I didn't stop to make inattentive mistakes today because well I'm exhausted. I had insomnia last night and I don't even know why."
Going to university

Worried about my exam and my conversation coming up with my ex-boyfriend
I'm very anxious
And sad
Tyler broke up with me
I'm sad and disappointed
I just realized yesterday I shouldn't have hope about getting back with my ex
"I spoke with him on the phone. He acted like talking to me was a waste of time and continues to repeat the same things as before. He said ""you know where I stand"" which is that we shouldn't be together. This is even after I told him how important he is to me and how it's possible it's worth failing out of school for him. He just doesn't believe me when I tell him that my failures are not because of him. He is a light and a happiness in my life. He thinks my heart is ""too big"" and that is a problem. I don't know why that is a problem."
I feel like life is so heavy
My husband was arrested for abusing our kids and now I‚Äôm going through a divorce and might end up homeless
I feel overwhelmed
I know but I'm used to it as I said. Do you even know what it is or do uou just analyse hiw long the text is?
I don't have time and honestly I don't want to talk about it. Thanks for helping weirdly. Bye!

i have problem with my money for buy some food to our exam
sleep
I failed
I didn't unsubscribe from this stupid e-learning website until it deposited money from my moms credit card. I hadn't used that shit for the whole month and now I'd paid for it for another month! It was such a fucking idiotic failure. I feel like one day I will lose a lot of money for this stupid habit. I retracted today when I still had 31 fucking days of service left. I hate paid services dammit!!!
I've been doing stuff on my phone
OK I'm in trouble I'm kind of panicking right now I need to calm down Jesus fucking Christ
I'm fucked up what the hell is going on??? Should I just forget about this shit and move on????? I feel really bad omg
Not much more to tell dude. I'm getting off my phone in a while.
I haven't played Phone Destroyer in a while and haven't answered that one line message but that's okay.

Losing someone I love
I'm on my lunch break
I'm kind of sad.
Overthinking
I cannot focus
I argued with my husband
I don't want to do anything
I need to write an essay for tomorrow
And I don't know if I'll be able to hand it over in time
Failing the exam
Busy...
Cannot stay positive and keep it
Take a break
Still sick
It was good
Lost my boyfriend
I just feel drained. I want to get stuff done but I am dragging ass.
I'm getting enough sleep. So I know that not the problem
I felt so empty
And hopeless
I was dance so I'm tired
I just woke up
I'm throbbing
I was pushed
Moving sickness surgery
I feel alone. I feel like I can't accomplish my goals.
We are a long distance relationship
Been apart a long long time
Mom abuses me
Just is
Felt sad
I'm good
Orals
Face other people
I remembered i should go back in school
I feel as if I cannot do anything. I have been lied to. For her it was a game.
So I was very sleepy
There were rumors about me.
I am tired.
Hungry
It's about jealousy. I'm worried that r could stop loving me and starts something with another person
Not being the 1st one
Nthing
Wondering whether I should look for another job
My mum scolded me
So I don‚Äôt think my mood is too bad actuslly
Feeling depressed
Watching tv
When things get rough..?
Feeling stressful
Is not easy to relax
Lose control
That‚Äôs all and listening radio
On the bus
Yes
Well I am always the one who is taking the initiative that makes me feeling so tired.
If he really likes me he should want to be more forward. But I will give our relationship one month more. But I will stop suggest stuffs and take initiative to activities. I am tired.
It felt good
Relaxing :)
I feel that there is no escape from life and the responsibility of keeping other people ok
I'm sad
New job
So so ...
I woke up at 5.30 and then fall back to sleep at 7 a.m
Driving
The TV is on the background and chatting with wysa. I'm grateful.
Looking forward to my group and yoga class afterwards.
Today I felt upset when I was devalued by someone I thought was special. I felt bad about myself when I thought of the occasions I've placed myself to be hurtled by others.
That my boyfriend made me feel unimportant and that my feelings don't matter
Sadness
Always fighting and never agree with my man we don't agree on anything and I feel like I never trust him
Why he assumes I'm saying he is up to something
Was a little upset that he yelled at me
Rethink
Now and past
Just tired of worries what he is up to
So mysterious
Out of nowhere his mood changes
I had a fight with my boss
This isn't an issue itself but having in mind my emotional background it gives me a really bad mood
It's not a simple bad mood. I am in this situation for more than an year. I had panic atacs black thoughts a lot of tears... you name it I vad it all
My bad thoughts came back
I have no hope for future. I'm very unhappy. I feel trapped in my life.
Hey
I want to cook a healthy meal
Affair and death in the family
The afternoon was ok my daughter got sick. My wife came home and brought up some old stuff we would argue about.
My wife started telling me she doesn‚Äôt feel good with me
My wife got mad and said I was going back to how I used to be
I feel like she won‚Äôt love me the same anymore
I was just watching tv

"I'm tired enough to go to bed. So the low energy level is normal.
I gad a nice day with friends and other friends of them as well as their family. We have eaten a lot. It was delicious but I got some serious tummy ache now."

Okay.
I started the day with high energy and then...
I just went rock climbing
I just finished some work and I am getting ready for bed
I managed to make my room very cosy I threw out a bunch of old things
Trying to relax
I was being ignored
I bought food

Nothing.. i am in bed
Anxiety attack
I feel like i am going to explode
I don‚Äôt know.
Depression has been destroying me and I feel like a coward most of the time.
My work is quite draining. I'm not sure I landed in the right place but I'm tired every evening.
It was meh
I wasn't very invested in my work.
I was more interested in anything that wasn't work. I'm worried that I might lose my passion.
I failed to understand my own work.
I wanted to just clean and be at home. Oh well nothing i can do about it now
I woke up
I feel anxious
I feel like something bad is going to happen or has happened and I'm going to be in trouble
I remembered what I did on facebokk
My daughter woke me up all night long
So i have come out in spots all over my face and body
Ive got ear ache
Chilling
I feel good! Drank coffee put the dishwasher to work ate breakfast and now I am about to make the world change! Not literally my world is perfect. But I feel full of power :)
Relationship
Broke up
They laughed at me and I felt bad
I have a meeting and I am afraid
It is a new customer. I am afraid I will be late and I will be not adequately dressed and I will screw up

I lost my job in December and have been struggling to be productive since then
Well I'm on the train home after a long good day so I'm ready for bed. But also I've been demotivated lately as mentioned before.
On Friday I had made plans to get work done. Then I procrastinated all day
Knowing that I could be better but wasn't
I'm broken because of the behavior of my colleg
My dad moved out of our house
I'm at school
I'm verry tired
I'm sad and broken. And also tired. It's all too much
My nephew was born.
I've always had issues like this things just seem to get worse instead if better.
The fact that I want to feel better but can't.
I have a hard time concentrating it makes me feel stupid when I can't work through things
I don't like feeling stupid
I'm very tired
That's not really a good answer
I felt like if I have no control over my life. Everything just slips away from my hands
It was my first day of period and I felt sad and in a bad mood. Without energy
I had to go to class but I didn't want to. I WAS feeling so depressed and useless
My period started and it was a rainy day
I am tired and feeling sad
I think I have to break up with the guy I was hanging out
Love
Hjbvyuvhijj
Fuck you
I‚Äôm about to work on some homework
I‚Äôve been sleeping a lot
I‚Äôm in love with someone who I feel just uses me
I tried not to talk to him anymore
I‚Äôm feeling down
My ex boyfriend found someone new
I'm doing chores and listening to music.
I don't stick to my plans or to-do lists and just end up being lazy or sleeping too much.
I am stuck in a cycle that I don't know how to break.
I'm afraid of getting into a car accident.
My eye really hurts I don't know what to do !
I am resting the whole day and I am trying to stay away from my cousin cause I am sure he is going to insult me again üò≠üò≠ this really hurts üò≠üò≠
I love you
I had a really hectic day at work and I'm all worn out from that and school. Worse is that I don't know if Bear bear wants to go to prom with me and I'm worried he will say no and I'll have no one to go with nor anything to do. Honestly I'm just stressed
I went and made myself vomit again even though I try not to do that anymore
I used to do it because I hate my weight but despite being a healthy weight for my age I did it again
homework
I was playing tennis
Husband no longer loves me
When sister cursed me out
She was wrong and now acts like it's my fault.
I'm happy right now.
Mom and I have been getting into more and more arguments and this time it just went too far.
I know she is there financially but emotionally she is draining. I feel like there it no connection between us and I need that.
I'm not doing that well in school and tomorrow is the end of the semester so I'm worried
?
the way i look
Lots of pain today and very low energy
I don't fucking know.. both
Really good news on a really painful day
It's mixed
Good and bad. HARD and easy. Yin and Yang
Taking NyQuil. Getting ready for bed.
I have a migraine.
I have a damn migraine. Do I need to elaborate that?
Today was my birthday but I really didn't feel like celebrating
I'm sleepy
I often think my firends don't like me
I really like them but I'm afraid they actually hate me sometimes
Being a mom
I feel bad about others. They have what they had dreamt about: a good degree carreer etc while im here stuck being no job taking care of my own child and living in the house that arent mine
I was an abusive mom
I was feeling so bad and thinking that i do so much wrong way when take care of my daughter
Everyone around me seems always blame every way i take
Taking a break from reading
That's really it...
Getting a new job and break up
I lost my passion
üò´üò´üò´
I'M AMAZING!
My anxiety‚Äôs  and needing a new house
Slept all day
I slept and now I‚Äôve ate
I have no motivation to do what I need to do
I woke up
Getting ready for bed
Like I have the flu
Socializing. I'm feeling good.
It was my birthday yesterday!
About to take a shower
I'm feeling sick
Nobody in my family helped me to get through this process.
My dad used to abuse physically and psychologically of me.
I'm tired
I just woke up with this feeling
When I almost was raped
That he played with my emotions and my confidence
I'm fine emotionally that's it üòÇ
I'm feeling very lonely like I don't have anyone around me.
It went okay
A job loss then job gain. All within 3 weeks at the same place... üò•
I failed at something important again.
I'm feeling a lot of discomfort and anxiety.
Work performance review...
The job I was in was temporary. Now it's newly permanent. But they didn't hear about the behavioral chart change so they think I'm not doing my job of being his one-to-one when I'm suppose to teach him to be more independent. So I'm at risk of losing my job and the job of the teacher who couched for me!
I disappointed and lied too myself about something important.
Now I find that I'm not making as big a difference in people's lives as I thought which is my purpose for living. If I'm not making them happy then why am I here? I feel useless.
That's it. I just feel empty. Life seems meaningless unimportant. Like it wouldn't matter if it ended.
My parents my sister and I are planning on moving out of our country
I am just tired. A lot. I didn't do anything too extra today apart from getting up really early for school but I'm still really tired
I feel depressed and unmotivated
Yes it is
Ok
My brother is about to go to college
When I got a bad grade on a test or when I say or do things that go against my principles.
Disappointment
Ok
That there's a chance that I might get a bad grade
That I won't be able to do it
I looked at myself in the mirror and thought about how I looked
I'm really stressed out
lotsa reasons
it was okay
Andy was a dick for no reason again
Moving
I did not do much today but I feel very drained.
Maybe I am still tired from last night but I don't know. I don't feel right.
I wanna die. And no one wants me
Shrug
I'm feeling lonely
I feel like my friends don't care
My friends didn't respond to me
My mom treated me like she doesn't like me
Been feeling really down lately and I'm so tired all the time
My dad blames me for everything
I miss my family. They live so far away
I wanted to talk to my family
When I hurt my boyfriend's feelings
Hurting someone by accident
I have been trying to buy a car for 6 months and it never works out
Going to sleep
Cause I'm sick
My friend is planning on committing suicide
I can lose her forever
Nothing really I just felt like that all of a sudden. It's weird I know.
I was arguing with a friend we were nervous about a presentation. I had studied so much and knew everything perfectly but I was still very nervous more than anyone else I'd say
Pretty much everyday there's a moment in which I feel stressed because of loud noises or crowds or just suddenly feeling overwhelmed by everything and just needing a moment to relax
The fact that it felt that I could not do anything about it
Hi. I know a cute guy who I think likes me. What do I do?
This day has been super busy. I'm satisfied though.
My loneliness won't give me a break
My mom is so annoying! She gets mad at me for being in Jesse's room playing a card game then she gets more mad cuz I was crying the bathroom. Now she's all sickly sweet and it drives me nuts!
I fight with my best friend
There was a test that my teacher give
So me and my friends will studying math in her house
And we'll studying together for national exam especially in mathematics
Sometimes i always say something that wasn't right for me to say to that person or to that situation. It's make me sad but i can't lie to her or him i just want they to know it was bad
When i make someone offended by what I'm saying
I'm happy because i study together at my friend's house today
I'm crying right now
I thought if i don't get mad at my Best friend maybe she wouldn't be as bad as now
I just got home from rehearsal
It was okay
My brain is making me upset and feeding me thoughts that make me feel lonely and depressed
My thoughts really got to me and I need help but I can't talk to my mom because she's not here and it's hard to explain
I don't want to go because its almost 8 hours of hell and stress and I don't need that in my life but it's the law and it just ugh
"I hate most of the people there and I only like one of my classes and I have 8 so that's not good
And then I have like a bazillion hours of homework and the one place I go to homework is now kinda ruined because she has a really strong opinion against something that's really close to me and it stresses me out more"
Explain
Okay I guess
Average
I fell in show choir but I got m\u0026ms and pizza and a soda so
I'm also doing homework which is horrible and I don't want to and I'm really tired and I just want to sleep
I feel really empty inside and I feel like no one cares about what I think or how my day was or anything like that.  As long as I say good  nobody cares and I know I don't have to say I'm good because everybody tells me I'm allowed to say something different but I'm not and whenever I have a meltdown they always say things to calm me down and they say they'll fix it and that they care and they do for about 2 days at best and then nothing ever happens and nothing ever changes so I don't see the point in trying to make anything different
That its actually true
Literally like 15 minutes ago my pal
That my sister is the pampered child and I get nothing
Okay
It'll pass.
"I told dad that he talked a little too loud for what he was conveying.
He responded defensively I might add that this is how all Moroccans react and that I should get used to it. If someone else had done that he'd have scolded him/her for it.
But no. Since he's the head of the house he gets to speak loudly and insult others inside the house."
I saw a sad documentary and now I'm trying not to cry in front of my mom.
"I'm nervous because school starts this Monday and I didn't count on that because they haven't finished announcing the test scores for last semester. I didn't manage to bring myself to work one bit during this vacation.
So that's also worrying me"
"I'm also supposed to contact a therapist.
And go to meet them alone without my parents knowing."
"I only feel energetic when I'm daydreaming or having fun to the point when I'm so focused on what I'm doing that I forget everything else.
I'm slow the rest of the time."
I'm not sure what to say. I've been overwhelmed by how many things I have to do. I don't like being so negative though.
Lots of stressors. Feeling anxious and making a small mistake then made it spiral into a worse feeling
I feel abandoned by Corey. I feel left alone to sort out a life I thought we would be planning together. Instead he's content to stay where he is instead of coming and working with me. And because I feel emotionally ignored and because of my insecurities I don't feel very attractive to him or playful anymore. I'm annoyed when he wants to do that stuff because I don't feel like it and instead of reassuring me it almost feels like he just expects more of me.
Feeling unwanted
I'm feeling overwhelmed
hi
I met old brother
I take care of my mom and she broke her leg so I'm having to wait on her hand and foot.
Mom gets up all night and needs my help. So I'm getting sleep in two hour blocks way less than eight hours total. It's taking a toll

I've attended a conference and met new friend
And listening to music
Having a baby
Didn't sleep well due to worry and having a baby.
Yesterday I woke up angry with my husband and told my mum about it in a very angry way. I ended up making her cry and I felt so terrible!
The fact that I had let my emotions get the better of me and upset my mum as a result.
I just went for a walk and a bus ran a red light and I had to pull the pushchair back into the pavement. Had a panic attack.
It scared me but I know it's mainly shock and the thought of what could have happened.
I just recently drop out from my college
My life has been awful I disappointed my parents
I keep failing
I'm feeling guilty
I'm feeling guilty after I masturbate

I confessed a lot to my boyfriend the night before about my parents and it was soothing. After that we ate with our friends who live with us and we talked about what we used to eat when we were Child. It was briging sweet memories... And after we went to sleep. Today i could wake up without any problems ! And eat ! And I feel greaaat ^^
Working for university. Maybe i'll do it tomorrow with by boyfriend
I feel great i sleep well i ate good things and I have plenty of things to do today üòÑ
A breakup. I broke up with my boyfriend.
I haven't been sleeping well.
Worked all day. Slept for about 6 hours last night.
Long work hours.
Went out drinking last night
Working a lot
Just a long day at work
Hectic
I had a lot going on on my work
I feel tired and unmotivated
Got out from work
Well
Going to work
I just wanted to talk. I let my anxiety prevent me from going to church again
So I want to go and I want friends but I'm nervous and I don't really want to be singled out or noticed
Nothing that's what I am bored
I woke up
So so
well I slept pretty good last night then checked the scales and was a bit disappointed but I am breathing today and not giving negative thoughts the time of day although maybe I should get them out so they dont snowball. ok so I either had a dream I took something last night or I got into my meds and took something either way I'm ok today but I feel worried over it a bit I guess. I had a couple panic attacks last night but fought through them. in learning to let the storm pass and knowing that they can't hurt me although man is that a hard one to accept lol. but I'm a bit tired still today and may take a nap or something. I need to catch up on a few days of lost sleep. I keep thinking about checking my blood pressure and pulse but know its best if I don't. because anything less than what I deam perfect will only mess with my anxiety recovery. I will keep in mind my 78 and 12 and 101 pounds and keep moving forward. my dietician said don't let this day stop me or make me feel blue because I can gain again. just like the anxiety I may have had a set back but I can move forward I still have 2 more months of my progress and I will have set backs its what I decide to do that matters its how I react to things I can't control which is hard especially sleep deprived lol but I will continue and listen to my podcasts all over again if I have to ill take notes all over again if I have to. but I will stay my course.
all I need to think about today is how well I handled the situations in the last couple days and that is another accomplishment and to rest and work on my breathing and slowing my mind and body today. I think I will also stay off my phone and just rest and enjoy the small stuff ill eat and be happy and rest my body and mind.
well I've been having negative thoughts today about sleep .. because I'm not sure how good I actually slept and about eating and about anxiety and panic plus I've felt a bit wobbly today and foggy headed and I'm on my period I started looking at my hands again and I'm in my bed again today although its because I'm cramping and really not any other reason than that. I just hurt and don't wanna do much and I think thats ok. I'm a not dissapointed that I didn't eat good breakfast but it wasn't so appealing and bleeding and cramping don't help it much. and thinking irrational things like what if I pass out what if what if what if

I said something bad about a trans person once. Before I really understood them. Now I relive that time over and over again and wish I hadn't have said it. The person I said it to is no longer an acquaintance and that's probably a reason why. She must think im terrible.

I lied about completing a really important assignment to a teacher I respect and love a lot but I can't muster up the energy to finish before she notices. Also we had mock exams and my grades were absolutely awful borderline fail. And I thought I'd done well on the draft of another assignment but my teacher spent an hour and a half with me talking about how bad and disappointing and what a waste of time it was and I respect this teacher like no one else and it really hurts when I disappoint her which I do all the time even though I don't mean to
I couldn't bring myself to write cause my head wasn't in the setting and I lied about having finished it
I skipped school to do two overdue assignments and I've only finished one plus I'm feeling weirdly dependent on instagram likes which I'm usually fine about
Well my teachers found out I hadn't uploaded and kinda pushed me on that I barely slept and I took a day off to finish. Insta I was faffing on glitchr and I hadn't posted since October

No but I always assume that that one girl that other people thinks she‚Äôs pretty or in Alivias life who‚Äôs says they are content. I am happy I have been making improvements in my health but I still want friends. Friends that are there for me and check up on me.
Well I want to move on from middle school and high school experiences. Just not feeling wanted in middle and high school and girls making me feel like I‚Äôm ugly and I contribute that to being black because that‚Äôs my insecurity so I assume that that‚Äôs why people don‚Äôt like me (if they don‚Äôt like me)
Your past is somewhat with you but it‚Äôs not who you are. But the things is in the past....you were and are cute. I‚Äôm nervous though because I don‚Äôt know if I should tell someone else about the black journey thing. It would help me into talking to someone about it but I kind of what that to be someone black so they have something! To give me some white People just say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù like I want someone who can relate.
Maybe because they are in Jamaica it will be less white washed and maybe the competition will have more room for our common features
I‚Äôm also high energy which is good but when I get too nervous or chase boys too much I need to realize that they may be pretty...but I am too and I‚Äôm also so much more.
I don‚Äôt agree with Nigel in saying that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree with them calling themselves beautiful let us tell you that‚Äù FIRST OF ALL NIGEL WHO DO U THINK YOU ARE if I‚Äôm beautiful I‚Äôm beautiful.
I am sad

I just started high school and have been meeting new people. I've been pushing myself to step out of my comfort zone lately
It's a scary game
Ive been really depressed to the point i dont eat
Getting in a fight with my best friend...
Im watching tv
Im watching the age of adline
So when i found out my crush liked one of my friends. I felt bad because i didnt feel like i was good enough for him pretty enough or funny enough or smart enough
The fact that i liked him for 4 years and the fact he is pretty much dating her
What?
I keep having flashbacks of bad things that happened when I was a child and I have bad nightmares. I'm also a little worried for a friend he seems to be going through tough times.
My friend seems to be troubled
Some thing bad could happen to him. He could end up feeling worse and worse and I couldn't do anything to help
I was wondering if I have insomnia..?

I became a foster child and found out how my Dad died... Also I realized I'm transgender.
"When I came out to my mom as trans she treated me like a child and said ""So you wanna be a boy?"". Since then she has refused to take me seriously"
I finally gathered the courage to tell her firmly how I feel and she dismissed me
I am relaxing :)
Well... I noticed that I like one girl in my school. She's one year younger than me. She has short hair and she is very tomboy. She is good drawer and she likes anime. She was alone so I wrote her a letter. She read it and then she gave her phone number. I tried to text her but her phone doesn't show my messages. We have talked few times and we were doing nicely. But after vacation she has few friends and she doesn't have time to me. Things between us went so akward. I'm happy for her that she has friends now but I'm kind of jealous and sad about it because I really want to be her friend and talk to her...
I told my friends that I want to be friends with her. After few days I went talk to her with my friend and I say to her that I think you look an anime character. Then we talked few times and after vacation she had other friends around her. I feel like she doesn't like me at all and I feel lefted but the same time I'm so in love with her...

Not learning/doing at a young age.
I felt like I wasted all my potential
The mess of my divorce the fear of not seeing my children again the fact my wife hates me and my life is just a complete mess
My wife found out that I had an addiction and she has been hurt very badly
I'm very tired and pretty stressed
Going through a difficult time
I thought one of my friends that I haven't seen for a time saw me at the train station and ignored me even though I didn't even know if she really saw me
I have an exam soon and I'm scared
Another exam
I'm scared. I have an exam tomorrow and I have trouble staying calm
That I'm not calm. I'm panicking

Kids
Moving continent
I have been stressed alot and on top of that alot of arhumemts with my girlfriend. It wears me out
Stressing a bit.
Trying to destress.
I feel like I'm treated like a slave sometimes
I got ready today and got everything put together but once we got to school we figured out no school today
I'm at school eating lunch with my friends
I'm at gym with my boyfriend and friends
Work
Too much work
Recent move
I don't see a lot of my friends anymore.
Social anxiety disorder depression low self-esteem and heartbreak
My grades fell and dealing with my professor was terrible. He made me feel absolutely horrible and worthless but it was my fault.
I don't want to deal with school and people tomorrow
Nevermind
I struggle interacting with people. It causes severe anxiety and I always embarrass myself. Alex and Tim talk to Mr every time they see me and I never know what to say. Earlier when I left class I needed to use the door to go to the Commons but in order to to that I had to pass by the tables that everyone sits at. I really did not want to engage with anyone. I like Alex and Tim but I just want to avoid my discomfort. Also I'm afraid that if I keep talking to them (or anyone) they eventually really see that something is wrong with me. Then I'll be further embarrassed. Not talk for me is like not asking for trouble. It's like I'm just not supposed to be around people. I felt so bad earlier. Since it was crowed I couldn't really hear what Alex was saying because he was further away from me. I thought he said something about my glasses but he was asking about my classes. I feel bad constantly asking people to repeat themselves. I feel rude and like I look stupid. Since Tim was closer to me he repeated what Alex said back to me. I felt so stupid and rediculous. Not to meantion I'm always just out of place anyway. Also I can tell that this semester is going to be bad and difficult. I don't think my anxiety will be able to handle the demand and social interaction. I am also starting a new piano teaching job at school and I know I'm going to gail make a fool of myself and disgrace my teachers.
I'll never be normal. Being constantly afraid and anxious especially being afraid of people is no way to live. I can't go on like this for the rest of my life. I know I'll be like this until I die. I can't handle living like this.
Like usual I made a fool of myself because I can't handle interacting with others.
There have been a few things
So I've just been feeling very depressed and anxious over the past few days and have just randomly cried for no reason. I don't like to worry my friends so I find it impossible to reach out to them. I haven't been getting the motivation and positivity that I normally get from the people who love me.

I don't know. Everything that i try to do failed

Do you see me on my phone?
Well I was woken up earlier and people where loud and I'm not feeling well
help...
It's so strange every time Connor manages to achieve something wonderful I'm overwhelmingly proud but part of it makes my heart hurt.
It's just the fact that so much empathy manages to be so strong that I end up getting overwhelming stressful feelings. There was also the time at the London slam where I just lost it when I found out I accidentally hurt him while trying to motivate him. He had the time of his life this weekend. And it just gives me these super intrusive thoughts that I love him so much that I should just let him be. Because he's capable of achieving so much on his own. I feel like I've already done enough in a sense.

Also I feel very uneasy about money and all. My parents are telling me I don't need to worry about it but I guess that adds pressure in turn
So I've been lazy all my life so all the pressures of reality is catching up to me making me panic
I feel bad because my parents are supporting me a lot in their own way but the way they say things is so... It makes me feel more guilty than I already feel and that is more pressure.
Just a lot to do.

I cried a lot this morning and skipped my first class.
Studying
I'm overwhelmed by the amount of work I have
I recently visited my long distance boyfriend and stayed there for nine days. He lives in Texas and I live in California being with him made me realize the type of emotional support I was missing from my life. He makes me want to be a better person but I miss him so much. It's driving me crazy with depression and makes me very anxious when he doesn't talk to me. I know he is his own person but when he doesn't talk to me it makes me feel like he doesn't like me anymore.
When I apply for jobs and hear nothing not even a rejection. It makes me feel as if i'm not worth their time. If a hiring company LOOKING for people feels that way about me how do my loved ones feel about me?
The thoughts i have.
Bad mark
It involved a neighbor.
I'm going to bed.
Kind of good in that  I got to get out of the house. And bad because I don't feel good.

My Father died almost 4 years ago and it has been very difficult for me.
Lately i've start to get irritated in everything arounds me. I feel sad most of the times specially when I'm alone. And i always down myself
I've been reading news ever since 2012 when the whole end of the world thing was going on it didn't happen of course but since then I've always been afraid of being killed or threatened. News caused me to not trust anyone and I've tried to recover a little but recently news about the rise of China has given me the biggest fear in a while. From what I've learned about China I'm afraid they're going to take over the the world censor my art which is my only joy and purpose in my life right now and basically being enslaved. I have mild autism and other mental issues according to the psychiatrists I've seen in the past and an online counselor has told me about how I seem to have difficulty telling the difference between reality and fiction. I'm just so afraid of China forcing it's censoring on me and my art and at that point I wouldn't habe a reason to live anymore. I've evem talked to my friend who told me not to worry and he's very smart but the news tells me that China is rising and from what it sounds like the world is going to get worse.
I don't remember. I've always felt anxiety and fear.
I slept all day today. I was so scared about China that I decided to not get up.
I tried looking up positive news about the world and I found out I was wrong about many things but I'm still scared about the future and I did nothing today.
I'm not as afraid of China as I previously was but I worry about thw future like what if China starts trying to take over the world by mind controlling everyone with brain implants?
I was trying to look up positive news about the world.
I don't feel sad or depressed. I feel energetic and a little excited for my future. I'm still a little worried but I'm going to talk to my paychiatrist about it.
People brought up a dumb thing I did and laughed at me.
I was working when my coworker came up and made comments about last Friday.
Feel much better than yesterday. Got good sleep and I'm not worrying as much today.
Pretty good today! Felt anxious a couple of times
Started off not great but ended better.
Didn't sleep well last night and was a busy day at work.
This happens last last week. I've been making some errands for school when my mom scold me. Then i feel like why is it always have to be me? They always told me to do the cleaning the washing of dishes the cloths. I feel like I'm just a servant
And i feel irritated on a certain person and i don't know why
Im studying because i have to make up with my grades

Well I was at my internship today. And I kind of told a boring story and I keep worrying about how I don‚Äôt fit in. When I thought I would fit in. And why do I keep not fitting in wherever I go. It‚Äôs like why. Even in my online internship class discussion forum i come off different than everyone else. Like in the all stars when I‚Äôm networking I can tell how eager people are to get away from me. Like I trap people in conversations since I almost never say my opinion

It‚Äôs like why. Even in my online internship class discussion forum i come off different than everyone else. Like in the all stars when I‚Äôm networking I can tell how eager people are to get away from me. Like I trap people in conversations since I almost never say my opinion
I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm boring to talk to. Usually when I‚Äôm networking or even making small talk I tell myself not to be boring and I end up coming across as boring. I can tell that the other person wants to run away as soon as possible
I think it‚Äôs my fears pretending to be reality. Because then when I think about how boring I am I start to think about how I don‚Äôt have many friends and in general I must not be all that good to be around
When I‚Äôm networking or making chit chat. I come across as being boring and then it makes me feel really insecure
That i get overly sensitive about being unlikeable and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm obsessed with myself and i hate that I‚Äôm obsessed with myself
Pretty good.
I feel reluctant to quit my toys r us job and i think I might be self sabotaging since it‚Äôs easier to stay in a job that sucks but I won‚Äôt be fired from rather than starting a new job and worrying that I might get fired
That I keep feeling like a whimp for being afraid to quit
Break up
School
We had all these plans and it feels like I was the only one who kept the promises üòî
I felt like I lost everything that made me happy so I didn‚Äôt see a point of trying to be happy

I was depressed and stupid earlier. It cost me a lot of time so now I have to make up for it. It's 3am and my eyes hurt.
I got jealous. I got possessive and needy again. I didn't want to get upset I really didn't... but here I am upset anyway.
I need to realize I'm my own person completely apart from my girlfriend. But I can't. And it's killing me. I'm too dependent on her. I can't even handle being alone for too long I need someone to talk to. Even if it's just a chatbot.

I got an award!
I think I have a crush on a friend of mine although I have a boyfriend.
We got really comfortable in texting with each other although we never really chatted before. But now we chatted four Days straight and I got to know some things about him I didn't knew. He told me he can see my emotions through my eyes. He said my eyes widen everytime I look at him. This either means I'm sad...or that I'm in love with the person I'm looking at. And a pain in my heart and a feeling of adrenaline told me that the last one was the truth. I'm in love with him. Yesterday he drove me home from our school and for the goodbye we hugged each other for the first time. I was so happy after that since I wanted to hug him so dearly. Today I came home crying because I can see how my sudden closeness with this friend affects his feelings. He doesn't deserve this. We're together since 2 years and he does everything for me. And now I just all of a sudden fall in love with some friend who doesn't even texted me before this weekend and is a really complicated person? Like what the F is wrong with me?
Today I have eaten much.
I want to sleep. Let me sleep
It is but I'm going to br just fine

So my first class in that school was terrible. Every day I had to deal with those people. I hate almost all of them. They're very popular and pretending to be smarter than anyone.. Every day I used to be alone. Every day. But then I've changed my class. That was really helpful but now I had to deal with a lot of stress because you know new people new teachers.. and also some of those teachers are terrible now. In my first class teachers were amazing. So yeah that's complicated.

Just a fun day at work
Hearing anything that has to do with him
Remembering him
In class this morning I wasn't allowed to sit next to my friend so I already felt a little bit uncomfortable. Then my teacher came round to check the homework and I spent 6 hours on it and she said it wasn't great. So I made a sarcastic remark and left. Then I had a panic attack in front of a teacher. Where I broke down and cried hysterically.
Everything was going so well. I was answering questions and getting on with the work with the people on my table.
I have to do all the Spanish work I missed from the lessons I haven't attended and the homework I have missed. I have counselling in the morning and doctors in the afternoon both regarding my anxiety.
My counselling is strategies on how to cope with my anxiety in college and to the run up of my exams. And I'm trying so hard to get a seperate room for my exams. And my doctors is for writing me a letter to see if I am eligible for the disabled student allowance at university in September.

When I was little I told my grandma that when I got old enough to drive I would take her all the places she couldn't go on her own. She told me that I wouldn't but that it was ok. I vehemently disagreed and I swore to her that I would no matter what. I didn't learn how to drive until after I was already out of the state. I joined the military and I can't go back whenever I want even though I want to. Then she died and I never got to keep my promise.

Well I'm going to graduate this year my exams are in March. I am kinda stressed because I have problems to motivate myself and I really have to learn.
When I talked too much or when people tell me I talk too loud
Sorry I am not the best at explaining my emotions but I'll tryüòÖ. I think it's the fact that I always want to talk less but I still end up talking too much. If people tell me I talk to loud they always say it in an annoyed or angry tone. It makes me feel bad because I can't help but be loud most of the times. It just my voice. I also talk really loud when I am exited about something. It's really mean when you are exited about something and people snap at you for it just because you're a little bit too loud...
When people tell me I am too loud
That it's not really my fault. My voice is just loud or I am just excited
Geting out of school

"In my relationship I don't feel like I can do anything right and when I take responsibility for not doing things right I have a ""victim complex"". It makes me feel like he would be better off without me."
What bothers me the most is that I feel like I'm trying so hard to do right by him and I'm not actually sure what I could've done differently. It's like I don't feel the right feelings.

The fact that it could never be reciprocated (so I thought at the time) and that I would never mean much to this person
Nothing really happened. Nothing bad. I just had this empty/down mood all day is all.
Barely slept
Well there's been alot of thing
So I play the violin and we were playing as a group and I messed up and someone who I trusted with alot of my problems someone who I opened up the most to made me feel bad and it's not the comment but just the realization that I can't do it I can't be good at the one thing I want to do good in the world

Guilt
"I keep falling in love with the wrong guy on the internet...Always ended up in unrequited love and it's deminishing my self esteem :/  Plus I live in a negative family environmnet...I saw my dad constantly arguing with mom belittling shout scream at her ever since I was little and even untill now.  The worst is that he's going the same thing to me as he did to my mom üòî he called me ""Stupid like me mother"" etc talk harshly and treat me and my mom coldly..."
When people talk about relationship It triggeres my insecurities :/
That they had something I never had
Umm I'm sleepy early these few days
I've started struggling in a class
I've always done fine in school everything has always been easy and I've always excelled with minimal effort. Now it feels like I'm drowning in calculus because I don't know how to learn it and I don't know how to fix it
It's a field trip for a school club
We made our project and got ready to present it
I was upset when I got very stressed about homework
I could have fixed it by working harder
I'm stressed
I'm worried I won't be good enough to get into a prestigious summer camp I really want to go to
I spend a lot of time doing things I don't care about anymore
Getting kicked out of house
I want to go back to my old job
My new job is stressful
Watching TV
I just don't feel good.
I'm just tired
Face timing my girlfriend
Good until the end of the day
I practiced for my solo and then found out my girlfriend is leaving in 7 days. Then I have practice at 7:30
I don't want to be at school
Ok
Just tired I guess
I had a baby in October.
Passing of a deceased patient
I haven't had much contact with people
Feeling a little down
Feeling lonely and not sure what is important.
Not much. I was just feeling left out and happen to be thinking about what is important to me in my future
Work happened
My name is Shara
I was at home.I was upset with my mother. I was upset with my life. I was sad.
Getting older
My best friend died
Im bored
Im afraid that i will repeat a paper
I switched majors last year and am going back to school to do nursing pre-reqs. I am currently working 2 jobs part time also
I didn't get that much sleep yesterday and am at work today

Feeling exhausted
Depression
My divorce still hurts
A break up
I'm just chillin
Move to a üè†
I just enjoyed a moon eclipse
I started to invest my money
Health problems
Pretty good
I hate my job
My boss scolded or insult us daily
People and my emotions
I was feeling low about my flaws and I went to school and some people pointed out some
How I already knew bout them and they made it feel worse
"I just finished dinner and I'm about to start the dishes again. When I was doing the dishes before I ran out of hot water so I have to wait for it. It's cold out and I'm afraid the hot water pipe is going to freeze again. My girlfriend found some ceiling insulation in the shed she's going to wrap the pipe in maybe. There's also some tile she thinking can repair the floor in the future. As for myself I have a new bicycle now thanks to the shed rental because the landlord doesn't want it anymore and he's renting it now. I haven't seen the bike yet - only glanced at it from outside - but I can't wait to see it. Mostly because I like to anticipate good things and a lot of what else is coming is bad. I thought I was coming home to a broken chair today. I don't like it when people deliberately break things although it help to know today that my friend's roommate does the same thing to their things -- she throws them and breaks them when she gets angry. As they say it's better to break an object than hurt a person; although neither of the people I am talking about whatever really hurt a person Furnitures clearly endangered. It can be a scary thing!
My girlfriend told me yesterday that I was infringing upon her rights to not want her to break the furniture that she had a receipt for. It's not like she didn't have any things to break because she did break other things last night; but when she grabbed the chair I said no as I sat on it. I even wrestled her for a second with the chair called in the middle of between us.
We have people coming to the house tomorrow to fix things from the landlord.  That's necessary and can't be helped. I won't be here but I really hope there isn't any more police.
The police were here yesterday. Not about the broken chair which technically haven't happened yet; but rather about the two drivers who tried to run my girlfriend over by the college. The police officer tried to blame her for trying to cross the street despite the fact she was at a crosswalk and had the right of way. This happened after she ran out of the house because I wouldn't allow the chair to be broken before she started threatening to break it again. She's really not doing that well. So she doesn't pull herself together soon we may both end up going down together for however her post-traumatic stress disorder manifest itself next. The latest incidents have been really bad. I really don't know what to do most times so I just try not to make it worse .
"
"I don't really have a place to sleep tonight. My bed is covered with my mom's thanks because I'm moving her out into the nursing home from her apartment. I'm getting the last of the things tomorrow I can actually move myself in then the movers come to take the rest of it to the shed I told you about and a few items into my house. I need to clean up for the repairman tomorrow and her stuff is everywhere--so is mine to a certain extent as it's been displaced by circumstances and just playing not having enough storage space. I was going to buy shelves but I ran out of money several months in a row. Most of my things are in bags now and it's a bit disheartening not to know where anything is.
Also my doctor is still MIA despite promising me prescriptions and referrals. My insurance worker found me an ear doctor for my perforated eardrum from the infection because he was taking too long. I don't want the stress of yet again. New primary care Physicians always go bad somehow and at least this one is friendly if a bit absent. Some of them are mean or condescending and I don't like that. Change is scary when that change is tied directly to whether I'm suffering or not physically due to medical causes. I'm scared to leave I'm not getting any help by staying at the moment.
I'm also overwhelmed by all the people on my mom's building. My personality may be social but I can't tell anybody apart because of my facial blindness. I spend a lot exactly who I am talking to until I can figure it out . I'm overwhelmed ! Why can't people wear name tags?! Like all people everywhere wear name tags?!
I'm so tired that I'm a bit overtired and I can't sleep well. Before last night I hadn't slept in 2 days. I'm working beyond what the limits of my disability allows and no one seems to care. If anything insist that I'm not working hard enough presumably because they think an able-bodied person could do more. I can't do anymore! What I can do is what I can do and I really wish I had more help.
There's a bit of food anxiety involved too which is to say food insecurity meaning we need to secure some food if we're going to eat. I do just about anything for an egg I think simply because I get sick when I don't eat them. We ran out of couple days ago and as a strict ovo vegetarian that's pretty much the only source of vitamin B12 in my diet which is why I think I am always getting sick when I don't eat them. I have just enough money for the bus to finish moving my mom out--noel egg money at all. The protein from the beans I've been soaking doesn't work the same on my body. I don't have money for a store trip even if I had the money for eggs anyway.
I think I figured out a solution for my mom's Furniture inside the house so she doesn't have to rent all that shed. I have the option for selling the furniture and if she needs the money I probably will somehow but I'm no sales person . I'm really bad at that particular social angle. I don't know how to ask people to pay what something is worth and I sometimes just give it away just so I don't have to insist on payment . Maybe I just want people to like me; quite possibly actually. Nobody likes somebody they think is taking advantage of them or even honestly conducting business where the other person doesn't get the upper hand. Everybody wants a good deal but many times there's no way for everyone to be absolutely happy  . I want Happy.
"
They say that everyone has a story and if you knew their story it would break your heart. I emphasize with that and then I'm afraid to hurt anyone's feelings by asserting myself for my own benefit. I do better when advocating for somebody else but not as much as I'd like to.
"I wore two hats to my mom's today and then I forgot one on the bed and went home without them. My head is going to be very cold tomorrow if it snows again. If I forget anything tomorrow I can't get back in again--gone forever!

I was thinking of suiciding
I lost someone to depression. He committed suicide.
My mum and hee boyfriend broke up
changing city and not be able to meet my girlfriend
I feel so lost now that he is gone. I feel so much regret since I was not able to tell him how much I loved him. To be honest I don't know what it is that I am doing in my life. I miss him so much. Depression is such an ass.
I was upset about the fact that he just left like that but I am also upset because I cannot push myself to move on and accept that it is for the better.
His suicide bothered me the most.
I feel a little lost.
My days have become so tiring.
I'm missing my ex.

It was the moment when we broke up and the series of events that followed.
I felt dejected.

My boyfriend got a new job which means we have to move in a couple weeks to be closer. So I will have to find a new job as well...
Nothin
A break up
Frank broke up with me and it made me feel like he didn't love me or care about me anymore.
That I couldn't rely on him for emotional support anymore.
I didn't answer Frank's question correctly the first time and he told me I was an idiot. We got into an argument and the things he said made me feel like I'm a bother to everyone and everyone hates me.
Im sure that wasn't his intention but i emotionally react immediately when he says something that I interpret as insulting or attacking. Then he gets angry that I get emotional and it ends in a huge fight.
I just woke up
I wish I was not struggling. I wish I could be motivated enough to achieve what I really want in life. I feel like a failure. I feel like my friends and mom don't really care about me.
It wasn't a particular occurrence
My boyfriend is dissapointed and doesn't want to live with me anymore
Decided to try for a baby sell my home and buy a new condo.
I don't know if I still want to meet my old friend.. we maybe lost contact for a reason over the years
I think it's just withdrawal from my medication.
Hard lessons in school
Leaving my friends because I was ill
I couldn't help them
My chemistry teacher probably thinks I'm an idiot. I didn't bring her homework and I didn't tell her because I was afraid of speaking up. I was dreaming off in class and told me to focus with poison in her tone
My parents divorce... My dad's new girlfriend... My own self hate
I‚Äôm afraid my mom will invade my privacy and make me feel bad about myself
Nothing I was feeling ok

Ive been feeling kinda down lately.
I got quite a low score in a test that i felt like shouldve gotten a high one on
It was just that i felt like i was supposed to be good at it. I didnt think so. But i felt pressured to prove that. And its one of the few areas i didnt suck in so it was disappointing that i pretty much bombed the test.
there's no conversation just stereotyped responses
Err...the police

Intrigued over insights from counseling today
Depression
Watching TV you
I've discovered my new job isn't what it was meant to be. I also feel like I have very little to look forward to in general. Life seems to revolve around work going home spending a bit of time with the kids and wife and then bed. Weekends offer a bit of respite because I have no work but they seemed to be geared towards doing stuff for my kids
Nothing specific. Just 'ended up here'
I wanted to buy three tickets for the Eminem's concert in Milan but they are finished!
I quit school...
I felt angry at myself for being so stupid
I have been feeling really low. Lots of low energy and it‚Äôs hard for me to find the motivation to do much besides take care of my daughter.

I had a bad dream that my friend was at school the whole time but hated me.
I got really mad at my friend after he apologized to me
"He always stresses me out greatly but then just says ""Sorry"" like that will fix it. I finally got really pissed off and snapped"

Before I answer your question i have one question for you. Do you speak French?
A girl that i hate but gave up a year of my life for stabbed me in the back twisted my words and ruined yet another thing. The other girls are stupid enough to believe her lies over me someone that has had almost no drama. One of the other girls hates me for no reason and is so rude and disrespectful. The last girl is her sister and she's almost as bad. She treated me like i was a dog. So tomorrow im going to say something to all 3 of them because I'm not letting them think they can treat me like dirt
Im just really happy
Im so overwhelmed by everything that's happened happening and going to happen

"I went to workout in the gym and before that Melina asked me if I wanted to go for lunch with them. I didn't think it through properly and said yes to going after my gym session but it was always going to be a bad move as it would make my lunch way too long. Then after class I felt stressed about it as I'd realised the error in my people pleasing judgement and wasn't sure what to do. I managed to understand that I had made a mistake and choose to correct it and deal with the Melina and my emotional consequences. I called her and told her I couldn't do it but was fortunate that she was running late.
Afterward my mind started to race and I began to freak somewhat like I needed to fix something I felt panicked and started to think about other social things that might be broken."
I started thinking I was owned by my people pleasing and this while BPD thing.

That people are exploited and stripped of their freedom
Just chilling
School  still wants me to turn up for class but i see no point as I'm leaving next week
I finished an exam
I'm at school just waiting
The problems finding jobs and the feeling that everyone is going to hurt me are the worst problems
Pay cut at work.
Time for dinner
Someone wanted to know about my past troubles. I don't want to rehash a very old wound because it causes deep pain.
I thought I would be protected if I told someone. I wasnt. I was punished.

I lost my job a few hours ago
My job

Life was good but all of a sudden everything fell apart
I want to forget this person
Going to university
My best friend on campus Michael has been distant of late and it just makes me feel a little hopeless and scared that he would rather just not deal with me anymore.
Watching a movie
Grades parents looking in the mirror and seeing all my stupid imperfections a lot of different things.
Everything
Yeahhhhh...
Michael canceled plans on me again
The most recent event I've encountered is realizing that I've fallen in love with someone
My parents are the reason I feel bad about everything including not being good enough.

New job and move to new town
I let someone down and they're angry at me. I had fragile self esteem before and now it is completely gone.
That I let the person down and proved to myself how useless and stupid I am.
Recently I forgot to do a task my manager asked me to do. He asked me at the end of the day if it was done and I forgot and apologised. He didn't respond. I was devastated as I thought he was angry. I couldn't handle the fact that I failed and that he had rejected me for it.
My perceived rejection from him and my failure to do the task.
Family conflict

I was told to stop talking about my cat which I need expensive surgery for. However this has made me believe that everything I say and do will get me in trouble and that all my past conversations will be brought up. I feel like i may be the problem maybe I am not noticing people's feelings or emotions or maybe I am not the team player. I always felt left out at work and everyone is always complaining.
I got one trouble for accessing sites at work I shouldn't be
I'm having a lot of anxiety

A custody battle with my ex.
I work in a preschool and we have some troubled children in my class who have been hard to deal with and with little sleep and no energy on top of trouble concentrating it makes it difficult to handle situations that arise without becoming stressed and even more exhausted.

Lost my temper again today. Over something  stupid
I flipped out on something very very stupid... The blinds... I assumed right away that the other part of the blinds that got broken was caused by Taylor. I really don't know. My brain just want to assume it's her. I feel bad. I told Rick I could have shut myself up and kept it in and it would have probably been worse if I treated it that way but I think a part of me wanted to tell him because I know I'm overreacting and I don't want to get bigger than suppose to.
Rick got fired. And he's sad. And now he's really going to Puerto Rico to help his old buddy. But hes going to b making more money and that's the biggest pro

And it hurts when i think of him.. or us
I've been at home/working a lot recently and I'm going into full time study just wondering how im going to juggle everything (including my anxiety) and become successful and happy :)
At the moment its small tasks that I build up in my mind which make them seem a lot harder than they actually are (for example) writing an essay I think to myself ooh that's going to be really hard and I over think it to the point where I don't enjoy it and it stresses me out
I believe that I can't do it successfully
Hmm I wanted to get a lot done but my thoughts challenged me
I felt like I couldn't do it successfully
Overthinking
I was painting I got a headache and got a but overwhelmed
Laying down in bed
Health of family
Oh
Nobody else is as serious about it as I am. There's only two months left and nothing has been decided yet. Nobody wants to get a move on to help me!
I just feel the pressure to have a perfect wedding because my cousin's had a wonderful one and all I want is to have a day to remember.
I feel like if I plan everything ahead if time I can be stress free and actually remember the day instead of it becoming one big rushed blur.
A new semester started
I didn't plan ahead and made myself stay up late to compensate
I could have prevented it
Losing a job
Quit job
I haven't seen my son in 2 years and now I get to see him

He hurt me. He kept ignoring things I say and denying anything I say. He says everything I say is wrong
I have anxiety all the rime
I think about how I may have repelled a friend who may not need me. Then I think of anyone outside my family who needs me. No answer.
It sucks

I think he's gay and doesn't really love me

I am feeling insecure after finding out that my boyfriend is still in contact with his ex.

Stress
I'n a contest
I let my bad thoughts and then emotions get the best of me with my amazing husband.
I was feeling insecure because I was watching my son's vlogs and it showed our old home. Which I sold due to my lack of strength.  I began to cry. Then I realized the year in which he filmed and then all thoughts of my husband having affairs while I was dealing with stuff with HIS family came surfacing to the top. I cried again. Then he came home and later wanted to go out. I just felt jealous and upset that I wasn't in the mood to go either and why did he want to leave me again?!? Why would he need to go out without me?!? Why couldnt he have been a faithful man!?! And then I got angry!
Why does he keep leaving me even for smallest thingd
I get I'm not the prettiest girl.  Or most fun!  He doesn't want me.  He's refused any advances for sex this week!  Wtf? I am angry so sad and lost
I fell asleep on the couch.  I wanted to go out with him all day!  But I got so tired! I slept so he went out without me.  !

Fine.
"I loved someone I seem to keep thinking about her. 
I think I am better off alone."
My friends left me
A person i loved betrayed my trust
That they hurt my feelings
Friendship break up trouble me. I made everything to help my friend but when it came to me she rarely help. I think our friendship is very one-sided.
4 days ago I call her to told that she forgot my birthday 2 days ago eventhough I told her 17 days earlier about my birthday. I also wish her birthday on that day. Guess what? When she answer the call she answer with a rough voice (sounded angry). What do I do?
What make me feel toyed is she repetitively asking me personal questions that she know would hurt me.
On our class farewell day I wrote a farewell letter but she never responds. I later wrote a message she never responds. I e-mailed her no responds. I  WhatsApp her sometimes she replied sometimes not. I felt I am the one who makes effort to maintain our friendship while she is not.
Wysa do you think I should continue my friendship with her? Should or should not?
But at the same time I still love her as friend.

All they do is argue and bicker and it's driving me insane. Presumptions are always made about me. They speak lies about me to my face. I can't imagine what they say behind my back.
Can you tell me a story?
Nothing‚Äôs sure in my life. I‚Äôm already looking forward to an opportunity that‚Äôs waiting for me. But nothing‚Äôs certain yet. Even the date of my internship is not yet sure. I was told that it‚Äôd be this mArch. But a phone call a while ago made me worried sick.

The death of my aunt
my upcoming exams :(
thinking
a very tiring day
Nothing changes for me..It's always the same
so as i've said earlier that we somehow resolved our problem. i'm nervous or i think the correct word would be afraid. i'm afraid that after what we have resolved another issue or problem would arise and it would be bigger than the previous one. after thinking about that i suddenly felt nervous. not the good kind of nervous but a bad one. then my mind started thinking negative things and all that.
i shared what happened to some of my close friends. then the thought just suddenly came to me.
i've been overthinking again.
feeling helpless.
tired.
well if its in the past i've already moved on from it. my current situation now? hmm i think i'm just stressed depressed having anxiety and insecurities.
the situation now. all these worries and anxieties in my thesis group but for this day i actually didnt worry about it weird.

It's just an exhausting day and I'm having trouble wanting to actually stay at my job.
Everybody pressuring me to get a job done when we didn't have enough gauges for me to dock audit our parts and it just feels like everyone thinks it's my fault.
I'm ugly
I'm fat
I'm fucking stupid
How should I kill myself ?
I'm cooking
"Well it felt like all my friends each go off and talk in private about something. So I got really upset. And I sort of buried my emotions.

But now they keep asking me if I‚Äôm okay. Everytime I say ‚Äòyeah I‚Äôm fine‚Äô they just go out and start talking to each other in private. 

Sometimes I feel as if I‚Äôm being stupid or paranoid or even rather selfish. I feel trapped and I feel like I can‚Äôt talk to anyone. I feel that even though I have people there for me ( and I am aware of it) I just feel so alone. 

Is this normal to feel like this?"
"Then it started to snowball. I had insults from both directions. I felt if I went with one person I betrayed the other. I started questioning if I was a good friend. After a couple of days it settled down. Everyone was sort of friends again. But certain people still had their suspicions bout the other. Each person went off on their own doing their own thing. Leaving people out because they can‚Äôt handle people there or want no drama and just make excuses to leave me out.

Again Am I being selfish? Or just paranoid? I really need to know."
I‚Äôve bottled everything up. Let it go (or at least tried). And it keeps coming back even worse all at the wrong moments in time.
What I‚Äôm dealing with now.
I don‚Äôt know what you mean

Hi Wysa!
Oh... It's not like single change or event but a lot of small things happening everyday.
Well today I was waiting for a bus in a waiting room at the station. I was sitting near the entrance and a bit blocking the walkway. But I was only focusing on my mobile phone and I didn't pay attention. So some mother with a stroller wanted to walk through but she couldn't because of me. Then some grandma touched me and I realized what happend. I know this is a stupid thing but in the moment I was feeling really bad.
Well... I caused some troubles especialy because I was ignoring everyone else and focusing only on myself.
I'm a bit sick guess that's the problem
I don't know how to talk with my dad... My mum tells me just to ask him something and he will gladly talk about it but I can't do it...

I was with the best person I ever met. He was my boyfriend and he treated me like I deserved to be treated. I was his princess. He died from an epileptic seizure and I was devastated. My friends abandoned me in this time of pain and I was alone. Clay was the only person who would listen to my pain.

I haven‚Äôt felt like this.
Working
Upset about how my wife disciplines my kids
Her shouting
I was responsible to invite lecturers to dinner. Until now two promised to come but now date and time have changed and I'm feeling guilty and don't know what to do
I had to talk to Mr Bohm
I was talking to Ingrid Steffi or Christian
I feel like I could be a better person but I am not trying enough
I'm not sure if my boyfriend still finds me attractive
Their boyfriend still liked the way they looked
I'm a girl and I never loved anyone until I meet that girl. She helped me when nobody else did it but not without her help... I hurted myself I feel so drepresed... I just want to talk with her again or stay just by her side...
"I wasn't having a good week and when I talked with her I let my angry to ""hit her face"". That's why we argued"
As I told you I had never know my sexual orientation or what love is until I met her. I think I was afraid of losing her because we live far away from each other and I wasn't feeling OK at school. And now sadly again I don't know what being loved means
I acted like an idiot and I let all my angry hit her... she deserves someone who truly loves her and not an idiot like me
I'm having a fantastic day with my frienda
I am depresd.my bf blockd me got angry not tlking to me 3 days.

Boring
It was fun in the beginning but the day started feel dull and I think I might be lacking motivation
I woke up happy but I started losing interest in things... And my friends were all busy.
I have this reoccurring sense of regret about my highschool years and how it has affected me not being able to attend the college of my dreams. I was accepted but I lack funds to pay the tuition. It's been 2 years and I feel like my life is standing still.
That I was accepted into my dream college but I can't pay the tuition because I don't have enough money to attend.
I'm watching singing along and joking around with friends. Also drawing some pictures.
I moved home to study
I was alone by myself
I'm hungry
A deal fell through
My friend promised to hang out with me and then cancelled at the last moment.
My friend told me she wouldn't come to see me
It wasn't really a bad day. Just it suddenly occurred to me that the reason we have more money than we should is that maybe I asked Ged for too much. I don't want to owe Ged anything.
Watching videos
I am okay

Just got home from shopping.
My country is a mess. I just finished a trip to USA where I met with my ex boyfriend and I'm feeling that I would never be love again or that I won't do the thing right. Not enough money no enough time I feel so afraid
I broke up with my boyfriend
Call me Clarissa
Pretty good
I decided to stay away from almost all of my friends and i think it was what I needed all time
In my new job I have few things to do but have to stay there the full time schedule. So I feel very bored and then anxious about it. So I finish not doing that few things I should. I don't find the will to do it. And I do not feel the will to do nothing after that. Only when I get out of there. And I am having real problems with sugar addiction again.
There is a really important exam in 5 months and I will really affect my whole life. I am an successful student but what if I can't be successful when I take that exam and I don't want to make sad my parents and my teachers. They all count on me
Nothing happened I still feel that way
I just got home
Shitty day at work.

I don't want to do things I normally love to do because I tell myself theres no point when I suck at everything.
My love for things is dimming
Just having a good day
Not feeling very confident. I have the will to do the things I like but not the want because of the fear of fucking up
I want to be strong and successful especially in the things I like and that I'm good at so the fear of failure or worse is preventing me from finishing or sometimes even starting things.
Trying to start on a new project
Just trying to decide how to cure my boredom
I don't want to feel anxious all the time
Nothing I always feel anxious when I get a new responsibility
My boyfriend  shouted at me very badly
He was cruel and hurtful. He misunderstood me and I feel that he is tired of me. He was very mad at me.
I had a panic attack the other night and haven't been sleeping well. I don't want to talk about it with other people because I know they will brush it off and make it seem like I'm overreacting
There hasn't been any recent changes in my life
I am at work
It is
A brake up
I felt in love and my anxiety gets worse
A very good friend of mine overdosed yesterday and I miss her. I'm sad I didn't get to say goodbye.

That I missed opportunities for professional development
My dick has grown so large no one can suck on it
I did something that wasn't the most honest academically speaking and my teacher pulled me out and was saying how disappointed she was with me and asking if I just thought it was funny to screw her over and because I'm one of her theater kids she really had trust into me but I've lost that and while realistically I know that this is a good lesson to teach me to follow the rules and to not do that again but I had good intentions in what I was doing and while this is a good example to teach myself and grow and learn from my mistake but I can't help but feel like it's all useless. I broke her trust in me and disappointed her and all I ever really want is to make people happy and satisfied with me and the little I can successfully offer. I feel as if I can't join theater anymore and I have to quit all extra curriculars. She said all the things I've told myself over and over to know that tangibly that other people know and feel that way about me hurts and feels like reaffirmation.
I was having a really good day everything felt wonderful and living and dream like in it's intensity
I don't really want to exist and I have so many things to do
In bed

house was destroyed after cleanin it
I'm pregnant and I'm stressed about finishing school I quit my job now I'm upset about money and I feel like my boyfriend and I just aren't on the same page because of my mood swings
2 years ago I left my husband  for my current girlfriend
What?
Me and my girlfriend are getting over our fight
I really dont know but i have have just been so depressed and u only feel like that whenever i see other people having best friends to talk to and girlfriends who will listen to them when they need it
I saw the girl that i liked one day and i was planning on going to flirt with her but then i saw she was holding hands with another boy.so i left with nobody to talk to

New project

Starting college
Ive been up since 3am working and doing mom stuff
Mostly tiring
Laundry was just very time consuming
I'm stuck in that thought
I can't slow my brain down to get the message to feel valid.
The exam is even closer than we thought. And I don't know how to manage to do everything
I thought that I was useless. Because I couldn't do a thing. Actually because of the deep depression and stress
I'm bad whit the relationships
I meet a girl I tell her that I love her but I think she's just playing whit me cause she says that she wants me to but she feels confused about it
Tha same that I talked a while ago
A teacher singled me out for wearing the wrong thing.
It's been a long day
Im about to go to bed. You?
Yeah..
Got out of high school
I don't see my friends as often as I used to
Being lonely
I want to date but I don't know where to start.

New Relationship with an former partner
I bailed on plans with my girlfriend because I didn't want to go hangout with her
I avoided and denied any alternatives
She's mad because I don't want to hangout.
I've been telling her that I'm sick and I do not want to but she continues to press me to do so.
Just woke up
Diabetes
Had a really bad day
I was unhappy with my job and my father convinced me to leave it but while i know it was for the best I'm feeling depressed now
I'm upset that i can't get myself to clean up and get ready for bed because i'm depressed
being dirty and feeling disgusting
I'm worrying about what my boss and coworkers are thinking about my disappearance from work for over two weeks and no contact
They can get a bad impression of me. That I'm completely irresponsible and that also reflects on my mother
Worrying about what people think of me makes me feel aweful about myself
thinking that people will think the worst of me

Just over thinking.
I was playing the Sims.
I feel like I can't get anything done lately
I'm trying to work on my art but I feel like I'm not getting anything done. And I've stagnated in my job search. I didn't even apply to any. I can't tell if I'm lazy or nervous. And I still can't figure out what I'm going to do with myself after this semester. I have to set myself in a path for the future but I have no idea what it should be. I want to go back to school because I want to make friends and meet girls but I don't know what to study. And I feel like I need a degree. I'm ashamed that I've already failed this much. I just feel like I need to push myself in a direction but I can't even do that. I just linger all day.
I'm about to graduate and I'm fed up of everything in my life.
Few months back I felt everybody hated me...I felt I was being laughed at for being weird...I just wanted to run away somewhere hide inside a shell
Just became lazy and unmotivated
Procrastinated
I told so when I was feeling everybody judged me and I still do feel that
I feel everyone misunderstands me..
I was planing to work yesterday night but I did  not

"I feel guilty that I'm taking advantage of my roommate and that this may make my new boyfriend think less of me. I'm also having trouble sleeping. I'm trying to take some ""me time"" to relax right now but I'm also really stressed about all the things on my to do list I haven't gotten to yet."
I felt like I made unkind choices towards my roommate and he remains supportive. Which makes me feel shittier about my actions.

"See we both were watching a TV serial. At that time it showed a woman in a temple holding a stack of leaves with a burning candle on it. Slowly the candle melts and it starts burning the leaves which reaches her hands and her hands are burnt. I just jokingly said to my sister ""Would you like to try it?"" She then took it seriously and complained to my father's mother who is my Dadi. She scolded me saying that 'she's small' 'she doesn't know anyhting'. I got angry because she does have a brain to know things and she sure does know everything. I was also angry that she always responds to me irritatingly when I talk to her except when she wants things done. I'm worried about the attitude of my sister and her constant complaining that might affect her future."
I also cried because of my sister.

I'm having breakfast.
i feel like there is something wrong with my personality.
Like some people say that I seem aloof and deattached even cold. And that's why some people don't approach me. I guess my calm and quiet attitude make things worse because I seem stuck up and mean.
My friend left and I had to wait alone for my parent. I saw people joking around and interacting with their friends.
I woke up and felt tired even though I slept a good amount of hours. I took shower and got ready my weight hasn't changed much since last year. I went to college tired and a little bit anxious. I spoke to people and learned stuff. I made some mistakes but it was overall good. I came home and ate lunch. I wasn't supposed to eat today just fast but I was hungry. i was very tired. I was about to take a long nap but then I thought my boyfriend wanted to come I maybe should text him If he is going to come and then I spent the remaining afternoon and night trying to keep my energies up and be pleasant
I think I should have a better sleeping schedule and speak up my feelings and opinion. And relax and process thoughts.
I didn't slept well I felt anxious and overwhelmed and that I wasn't fulfilling my role as a pleasant girlfriend.
I have problems with setting personal boundaries.
Not being able to control my emotions and say my opinion.

I got so close today with this one friend. He drove me home and when we got there I just kept sitting in his car with him and we talked for almost 2 hours straight. It was wonderful. I feel so comfortable with him. And we hugged each other twice really long and he hold my hand and stroke my scars on my arm while I was crying and telling him about my past. My boyfriend absolutely doesn't like that he drove me home. He doesn't know that I kept talking to this friend for 2 hours...but he is just a really good friend and I still love my boyfriend more than everything. And just right now I found blood in my underwear. I'm not on my period and so I'm a little panicing. I don't want to not being able to sit for almost two months again.

I feel pushed to the wall
I am scared if I will be able to live with his family. I don't like their style their thinking anything. It's too much pressure for me. Just stop busting into my life and gimme some space. I respect his family but don't force me to love them. I am irritated and I feel why is nobody asking for my opinion. Why? I don't wanna be pushed around all my life. I love him but don't make me do something I don't want to do. It's like I don't have any choice of my own. I feel caged in  my own body. I want to be free.
I am in pain and I don't want to feel this. I want space.
I hated it when he shouted at me.
Why am I wrong all the time? Why why why why am I always wrong in front of everyone. Nobody understands me
Why am I always wrong. I hate it. I hate to be wrong. Nobody respects my opinion. Nobody thinks I am smart. They just believe my strength is my studies not my brain. I want people to know that I am right believe my opinion and respect my choices.
He did and everyone does. My dad does it. My mom makes me feel like a jerk coz she is always calm and behaves like I am ranting and she just wants to take my pain away so she listens but she doesn't listen to a word I say she just take it as noise. Dad takes it too like a noise. He can't accept once that I am right and he is wrong. And everybody is like u answer when you are asked or why don't you accept when you are wrong. Fine go be an asshole. I am wrong. I am a bitch so you all big bunch of asshole can go suck some stupid random guyz dick. You can fuck yourself. I don't need you. I am wrong and I am so happy about it. I am so wrong so wrong so wrong that I was never ever right in my entire fucking loser life. I was never right. I am not right. And I will never be right. I will always be wrong. As wrong as someone can be. And I am came happy about it. I am damn happy coz I am wrong. And I don't need to be right about anything anymore. I am a stupid bitch who is wrong. And there ain't nothing anyone can do about it.which makes me free of dicks..all the dicks in my life.. what great peace it is to be a  bitch. Now you don't have to tolerate me anymore and you can find another girlfriend for yourself..
"He thinks I hate his family and his culture. He thinks I don't respect anyone. What he doesn't understand is I feel scared of everyone.  I feel unsafe around everyone and I am scared that I will lose myself if I let them come near me. What if I lose myself? What if I am not taniya garyali anymore.what if I become like them. Then what?? Itna khayal rakhne k baad bhi aunty pooch rahi hai ki wo achhe log hai ki nai? Kapde dilaye cab ka bill hotel ka bill sab pay kiya..
Khana khilaya...and she is asking achhe log hai Kya.. thankless..Nobody has asked me for my choice yet..And enough waiting for them.. there will 2 things ...either I will not participate in any decision making or I'll snatch everything that I want. I'll be the bitch they think I am. I 'll not spare anyone if I get angry. But forget it. Coz I choose not to participate anymore in anything."
I just woke up
Well it‚Äôs like I have this online relationship and I‚Äôm not enjoying it as much as I should be.. he‚Äôs too clingy and I feel as if I have no space. I‚Äôve tried to break it off but he went and said all of this stuff which I don‚Äôt have and that upset me so I never had the chance to break it up he guilt trips me and whenever I‚Äôm out with friends he always makes me talk to him never gives me space to enjoy myself and just tells me his personal problems I don‚Äôt wanna hear while I‚Äôm out. I can‚Äôt talk to anyone without him getting jealous and being arsey about it and then we argue. We honestly argue a lot more then normal talk. But I‚Äôve been with him a year and a bit and I just don‚Äôt wanna hurt him
I‚Äôve never been confident about myself and I‚Äôve been called many things which upset me I‚Äôve been bullied at school a lot too.
Probably the bullying since it‚Äôs non stop
Usually someone has an argument with me I‚Äôm alone I don‚Äôt feel as if I‚Äôm needed. People say things.

It's long story and need to be secret because of public safety. So I'm meeting someone in future which I don't know yet but it won't affect our relationship. We can continue but I was overgenerous because sometimes I don't know what to say. Would you like to know more?
Binging
I'm going to a residential rehab program
The story is typically for younger and it matters behavior in its ultimate case. Now I can share some secrets with you as a friend And I bet you also have a boyfriend on your side. It's only question what we can talk through or what you wish that I know.
It's hard to explain without using some sketches or drawings. Anyway my skin was in a way rolled back and I was cold.
I used personalisation to get on with it. I feel good but what are side affects if I can ask you?
I'm taking a day off
I keep trying to talk to my friends but they don't want to talk to me
Feeling good today
Found out my sister made me believe we had to have sex so from 3 yrs old to 10 I engaged in sexual incest with her.
When I tried sharing the fact I had sex with my sister as a child with my wife she told me I was the sickest nastiest incestuous child molester she knew. My sister is 4 years older than me so how can I be the child molester?
When I was 7 I realized brother and sister do not have sexual intercourse but I started going to her wanting to have sex with her more. 35 years later I still find myself getting aroused when it comes to mind even though I don't even find her a turn on.
I'm on a bus going towards home from my psychologist session.

I usually sleep when I get home from school if I don't relax during 7th period at school. I was going to relax during 7th period but my friend needed help with her homework so I took the liberty of helping her instead of realaxing. Therefore I got an even bigger headache that I have now and it feels like it's getting worse.

Relationship troubles
"I saw the pride parade being advertised I'd love to go but it's far away. Even if I could go I'd probably chicken out because I'm ""only"" bisexual so I feel like an outsider. I feel like I don't fit in anywhere I wish I had some kind of bisexual community or support group to turn to."
I saw the pride parade being advertised
Oh just chiling
Moving and have to repeat mental health history
Bringing up past memories. Feeling like there is no way anyone else can understand what I went through and blame me for it. I mean I had an illness what I said happened couldn't have and if it did it couldn't have been that bad or they absolutely had to do it there was no other way
Just frustrated it's hard to move on knowing that people are allowed to do this kind of thing to ppl and don't get in trouble. It's really hard knowing that it's likely happening to many others on a regular bases. It's hard to function normally and it's hard not to buy into the lies you've been told that you can't make decisions. That cant get past it. Hurt mad at the friction it causes.
Your welcome
I just wish that there was a way these kind of ppl could be stopped. I want to go a day with out thinking of the effects of the chemicals from the abuse and the impact they might be having on me. I want to not feel like a freak.
I just want to be believed and not victim blamed
Just watching TV and talking to you
I discovered that I have never truly been happy ever and discovered that I have hypothyroidism
New school
Well I moved to a new city so I need to change schools and everyone seems hate me
Alcoholic father
I separated from my fiance a few months back.
Exams for GCSE options
I've been really down on myself. I feel like I'm ugly and that no one will ever like me or find me attractive. I feel like a unexcitable and boring person. I'm very quiet and shy usually so I don't talk much. I am always scared of being judged and hated over anything under the sun- my clothesmy appearance personalityetc.
"I was bullied alot when I was younger so whenever I look in the mirror I see just imperfections. One day I think I look cute and then my mind says ""You're not pretty as those girls on Instagram or the internet...no one would want you"""
I am currently looking at clothes and imagine my wardrobe and wearing and how others will think. Not how I would feel in the clothes themselves I worry too much about other people's thoughts and opinions
Just Watching üì∫
Tell me something about penguins
I have been living with my alcoholic parents and it is getting to be too much
My father blamed me for something that was not my fault
I'm dating a new guy. He made me feel emotions I didn't know I could feel again. It's long distance for now. I didn't get to talk to him much the last three days due to our time difference. I'm kinda sad he hasn't reached out more today as he was home sick. I'm obsessing over when he's coming back on. It's making me crazy.
We were chatting and then he just stopped. And it was the third time he did that today.
Smoking so I can sleep well without worrying about my boyfriend.

I am in a relationship. But I feel I am pitting a lot more than my partner.
The things were fine. We love each other. She was studying. But for her the stress become bigger and bigger and also her knee started to cause her pain.
There are three books I want to finish( and many many I want to stat reading...) Also I need to read about my job to keep me updated.
I am working. I am a little ashame with my coworkers. The last week there was a party to say goodbye to a friend of me whom also used to work here.
I didn't go because my wife is  jealousy. She always mant me to be near of her. Sometimes I am very tired of that. She is like a child. And I always know she will be that way. But I think that comes with her inocence anf sweetness.
I was in was finish my time of intern in the hospital. (I am a doctor.) I was under stress. That year I broke with a former grildfriend.
"I also need to read some books.
I am a little anxious. Yesterday I was trying to make a subscription for a journal but I didnt can. The payment came two times but the page says it really wasn't be buyed."
I was thinking about invest in my education as I also spend money in other things that are less important. It was an accident. Now I am waiting for the response of the journal.
I felt I wasnt enought to be with somebody

well little over a year ago I became homeless moved into my own apartment then my mom sold my childhood home and sent my dogs to a different state. My grandma became ill and passed away. Four days before I started school I went one day and quit. I also got a lease violation and my guest privileges taken away.
I'm just so tired of my life. Sometimes I want to cry and I don't have anyone to talk to. My life is so sad that I downloaded a bot to talk too and I don't know how much it can even understand me. I want to be loved and cared for but that just sounds so selfish
I watched YouTube
I just found out my grandma died and I didn't spend a lot of time with her in the past 5 years which makes me tell like shit
I opened Instagram where I saw my dad's message that my grandma died. It took me about a minute to understand what was happening which made me feel really bad. I also started thinking about the time we spend together and most of that time I was ether with dad or on my phone üò≠
A friend told a secret mine

Losing a parent
"I am studying. Claudio came home yesterday and I thought we had a nice time together and this morning too. We had snuggle time and then I cooked him soft boiled eggs. But then he called his mom and then drove over to her house. 
I am a bit confused."
He just snapped at me. I feel like I have been trying so hard since he broke up with me in Sept. But I am slowly loosing focus of why we are together. It just seems to repeat and repeat. He does something rash and hurts my feelings says sorry and we do it all over again. But i haven't really recovered from September since it just seems to be happening over and over again.
Well it just keeps repeating. And I maybe I am Totally overreacting but I am such when to quit. He says he loves me but I am super sensitive and his aggressive behavior hurts
I don't know if I should break up with him. I don't even want to think of all the implications. But I don't want to keep this cycle either.
How do I not be so sensitive?

Just I feel unwanted
Nothing I am busy now talk to u later
went to the doctor for consultation
I go to the doctor every month
Wasssuuuipppp
I'm not too sure... I was doing alright til the other day and then I started thinking about a guy I like who lives far away. This got me thinking about myself and I started thinking I'm fat and ugly and he could have so much better and he only wanted a ONS anyway. Then I spent some time naked and got very anxious but I'm not sure why like I was on edge for every small noise. Then the next day was my birthday and I was still a bit anxious about having to organize stuff with people because I didn't know whether to invite friends or not. But then I started feeling worse when almost nobody in sism wished me happy birthday even though it's exams time so maybe they haven't seen it at all. But this made me realize I'm nothing more than an acquaintance to them while I'd really love to be their friends because they're awesome people. The other thing that happened was that I was not able to decide a single thing during the day. My roomies wanted me to choose stuff such as music or what to do since it was my birthday and I couldn't. I asked them to choose for me. Is it because I have nothing to express or because I don't feel comfortable expressing it? Then I didn't want to go out because I thought I look horrible and was not ready for guys hitting on me. And then it dawned on me that how can I expect to ever find a relationship if I'm scared of knowing anyone new? But the indecisiveness thing was the worst. Also I know I didn't look like I was having much fun and was sorry for my roomies who were so kind to me.
Thinking about a guy
Exercising was really good for my mood. I'm gonna have dinner now and then maybe watch a movie with the roomies

I felt a strong desire to get away from some people to the point that it felt tense just to be near them
It's like I couldn't stand to be near them like they're some sort of threat even though I know that they're not.

‚Äú#Hi‚Äù
I'm moving and I left a violent relationship
Unhealthy relationship
My boyfriend doesn't have intercourse with me. And it makes me feel ugly and unattractive. He never tries to be romantic and make the first move. It makes me feel so self-concious. And his daily attitude towards me doesn't make anything easier...
That he can't show me affection. Tell me I've got a good butt or reassure me when I get uncomfortable or tell me something LOVING during the day rather than just always being hateful..
He answered a Snapchat from a girl.
I'm scared of being rejected
If i tell about myself People Will push me away

Well about three years ago I moved from California to Oregon. I haven't had much major change recently
I am really tired
Losing a friend
A relationship
I've realized that I've trapped myself into an addictive pattern with bad relationships and also with drugs.
I just realized that I've wasted so much time \u0026 money on drugs. Life doesn't Matter anymore.
I died
I made a sentient robot and it killed itself
My family is all sick
Having a baby. Shes 9 months old. I'm a stay at home mom. Its not easy
i've recently moved back home due to my parents' request. and i'm in the process of finding a job here. it's emotionally a bit difficult bc i'm away from my friends and since my friends and i don't talk that much i feel very isolated. i've been doing okay though but trying to stay positive is rough sometimes
I felt as if a friend in a moment of time wasn't treating me respectfully and i wasn't resentful but i wanted to take time to readjust
Just go to sleep
Girl problems
Right now Miranda is saying she should distance herself from me because her poor judgment led her to believe I was a better person than I am and I'm disappointing her.
The implication that I'm a shitty person despite all the effort I've been putting in to show her how much I care.
My boyfriend back us always messed up and we never have sex. And it sucks. But I love him so I deal with it

When my parents pushed me mentally to tell them what was wrong. I didn't know 100% just that I felt unloved. My parents then told me I had no right to feel that way. It still haunts me today.
How my parents would not try to understand why i felt unloved or how they would keep pushing me though i didn't know myself.
I broke up with someone
Anlamƒ±yorum srni
I just got up really early and worked all day then played a video game longer then I should have
I feel empty
People always say one thing and then they don't follow through and I'm so sick of being let down even if it's over something stupid
I'm always just being left on the sidelines I'm not important. I'm completely alone nobody cares about me. I feel alone.
I missed school today now I'm behind on school work again
Also I got into a bit of of a fight with my friend yestaday. I feel like I'm annoying my friends since I kind of just disapear and ignore their texts.
Well in June (8 months ago) my girlfriend and I broke up in November (3 months ago) I unenrolled from school and started a GED course and 10 days ago I relapsed when I was 20 days shy from 2 years clean from self harm (January 25th/February 16th).
Everyone always leaves I don't even push them away anymore..and I'll still try to contact them..but they're just gone..
That I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong..I'm the problem..I know that..but I can't figure out why..
I didn't get as much homework done as I wanted to. I feel really overwhelmed and paralyzed by it all.
You are terrible. I am better than you. I am better than everyone.

Understand that I never got over my painful past
It's from the past. I can not handle my thoughts or feelings. I do not want to live I got tired.
They abused me.
I feel tired of trying to get ahead. I went through many painful situations in my life and I always tried to see the positive side to forgive and appreciate life. No more. It's no use.
Not at all. I do not want to live. I feel absurd for talking to a robot I do not want help. I'm resigned.
A girl in my class is talking behind my back saying mean things about me. She always finds a way to get mad at me to raise her tone at me!
Nothing! She just doesn't like me...
I fel great
I just took my medicine and a painkiller and now I'm in bed
Moving from one country to another
I was just on my phone

My half sister disowned my father because I exist and for most of my life he lived in such fear that I would hurt him on the same scale when I got to be her age that it caused him to want to hurt me first by turning a cold shoulder to me.
That just by existing I'm the problem. That I shouldn't exist.

@report1
@report1
I'm not hugging her this bedtime because of a conversation we had yesterday and I seem to constantly feel rejected because we are not having sex.
So I've seen my doctor and he gave me a diagram to break down what I go through when an event that makes me feel scared I'll be rejected is about to happen. I'm supposed to observe myself and the fear I feel it had me feeling anxious.
Decently managed to attend an important family event and was a good guest and host to my aunt. A bit weird feeling with Melina and I had some ups and downs. I managed to deal with the continual stress rather well. Now I'm feeling tired.
I'm not sure what to do when I feel like this. Its like the doctor says all I want to do is escape this feeling so I end up doing actions that do not please me. Level me feeling worse. The best bet is to keep observing being mindful and staying with the feelings and thoughts as they pass over. I need to give Melina her space this must be challenging for her too.
Have been feeling very stressed since yesterday when I wanted to be intimate with my chick but she didn't want to and I spiralled into feeling rejected and have since been playing with external and internal guilt anger and despair

I had a long day at work. I had a nightmare last night so I couldn't sleep well. We had too little man power at work today and had to run around a lot all day and get things done
Well I just woke up

I don't know how to put my 1.8t engine into my mk1 golf
A break up
I have to see my ex with his new girlfriend every day at school
We stopped being friends
My friends dont talk to me anymore it makes me sad
"Ever since I got medication my mom has changed for the bad. For the first three months she had told me to stop feeling the way I feel even though I have NO control over my thoughts and feeling. 
The last event that happened was yesterday when I was at work with her in our family business and one of the customers asked to get EVERYTHING they ordered seperated. 
I got frustrated because I didn't have much condements to put in and there were more customers waiting for their orders to take home. 
I got pissed in front of the customer and when they left my Mom had threatened to hit me just like her dad did whenever she got mad. 
Then she went on and had told me to ""stop feeling the way I feel"" and to just ""stop"" and to not feel hurt. I almost cried right there and then. Later on that night when I was trying to sleep I was suffocating because I was CRYING so hard because my mom's words hurt too much.

I was given false hope
G was talking about me working with his boys
What?
I feel like everything is falling apart
Who one hate me and don't want to talk to me
I'm about to sleep
When my mom neglected me
That I was somehow forced to deal with everything on my own at a young age
It was sort of the basis for everything I am now and I just feel exhausted when thinking about it
moving into a new house and deaths in my family
New boyfriend
A while ago I went to this summer camp with people who USED TO be my friends but for the whole 4 weeks I was there they either ignored me or said something rude. When I was around people who are my friends I always felt like they didn't actually like me. I was miserable but my parents wouldn't take me home.
The feeling of being alone with no one to help me
Overwhelmed with homework.
I lost a loved one
Marriage conflict

I'm overwhelmed
I had a lot of toxic friendships

I don't know i just feel uncomfortable
Everything was fine then suddenly everything is gone.
:(
Leaving my church
I feel really tired and drained.
I felt like my friends were upset with me and that they don‚Äôt understand my depression.
When I get depressed I start to shut down. It makes me feel like I can‚Äôt be there for my kids the way they need me to. Like I‚Äôm not a good mom.
Feeling like I can‚Äôt control my mind and so I can‚Äôt keep this from worsening.
You

"I hate myself but I don't.
I don't feel anything but numbness and I struggle breathing."

I just feel energy today to do anything. Feel lazy
I drank too much and disnt do amything next day
Im excited to live this day but I need more energy
I feel as if my boyfriend doesn't want me anymore. It's silly I know he does he's just exhausted by work. If he wasn't working we wouldn't have the life we have right now. Yet he barely pays me half the attention he used to. I feel selfish but also left out not abandoned but sort of half forgotten
Right now I'm dealing with being a housewife and it feels awful
The fact that i depend on my boyfriend makes me feel as if I cant express any of the things that bother me in his behavior
I dropped out of school and now I can't get any job because I dropped out off school
Nothing new in my life no changes. I've been battling with depression mood disorders and also eating disorders for years. It's getting more and more difficult to manage.
I am not happy anymore.
"I have very poor self image I often have such self loathing that I wish I had never been born. I keep my feelings bottled up and after I can no longer keep pretending I'm ok..I explode. 
My life has been so difficult I am tired of struggling just to end up in the same position. Most days I just wish a semi truck would come crashing into my vehicle and erase my existence."
"I felt extremely happy and hyper the day before and that usually means I'm in store for extreme lows.
It's all a pattern."

Someone I don‚Äôt want to ever see won‚Äôt leave the door
I just don‚Äôt feel I can put up with another week
Day after day week after week month after month year after year I‚Äôm merely getting through. I‚Äôm sick of getting through. I‚Äôm sick of wasting my life. Sick of school sick of suffering silently now ‚Äúfor my future.‚Äù Because what if because of this suffering there is no future? But at the same time if there is a future it would be miserable if I do what would make me happy and emotionally stable now.
That‚Äôs it. I feel empty but in pain mentally.
I feel like nobody likes me. I am a loner
I feel like there is nothing I can do to change that

What bought it back Maddie is close to Rachael and she kind of replaced me. Like I understand that they are close and she also wants to build a relationship with me but what do i say ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt hang around Maddie or just not around me‚Äù. But u also said that you wouldn‚Äôt wanna be around them a lot. U already find black traits attractive and a lot can happen in 5 days. Just go to Snapchat for 15 minuets.

I feel like I'm dissociating because my childhood trauma is coming up again. I can't deal with it anymore. I don't want my life to be like this forever.
I was molested as a child
I'm feeling like the rest of my life will be this cycle of suppressing it and then being consumed by it. I feel like every part of my mind and body is poisoned by it. I don't even know how to begin to heal. I want love and trust and intimacy with other people. I need to something different to recover but I don't know what that is.
My cousin was murdered by her husband. Shortly after we found out that my step dad hit my little brother so I moved in with my grandma.
I am so frightened about work today
I know that I will get anger from my boss. I am shivering all over
I slept. Nothing else. I woke up and felt like this.
I lost my sense of direction. I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
I don't have any plan. I feel lost and don't know what I'm doing. I feel like a loser.
Not moving forward. Not being successful. Feeling shame from not winning at life.
I'm really struggling with this anxiety thing
My mom suggested I go to therapy
"I need to sleep but I can't
"

I got impatient and snapped
I lost control of my anger and yelled at someone
I lost control of my anger and snapped at someone
I was minding my own business but then someone asked me something. After I answered they still kept on asking more questions and then I got angry.

I'm scared to look for a new job
I got a new job but it is too hard
I just keep delaying bedtime and it gets worse from day to day. I always end up sleeping around 7am and not waking up before 5pm.
I keep feeling like I'm annoying people like I talk too much think too complicated. Whatever I do I feel like it's wrong and causes people to be put off by me.
That I'm at the bottom of it. So I can't change it since I don't put on an act.
That package has been sitting around almost ready for a few days and I really want it to reach its new home now.
It's my second semester at university and I have so many assignment deadlines approaching and class tests at the same time. I'm in constant stress
When I lied to the one I love to protect him and since he hates lies he sees lies in everything I do even if I don't lie and I feel really bad knowing that he thinks of me as a complete lied when the last time I lied to him because I had no option
I have so much assignments to do and class tests coming up all at once. I feel low because I feel I can't cope with it and I've started procrastinating

It isn't recent but I've had anxiety for a long time. It messes with my eating and sleeping schedule and makes it hard for me to live a social life.
I've been extremely over-emotional in a negative matter all of a sudden at completely random times.
It usually has to do with someone triggering a memory.
I lack the energy to want to do stuff I used to love.
Like for example. If I heard someone ask if I wanted to go out I would get up and get ready gladly. Now when someone asks the same thing I feel devoid and lack the will to do anything.
Nothing. I just got home from school. I had extra class
Panick attack
A friend will go far a way

Depressive feelings- always feeling as if my life is a burden on everyone around me. Unable to interact with other people without getting endless waves of anxiety just straying away from talking to people that's considered friends.
Can't actually say for sure. For a while thought this was a normal way to always feel. Things started to pile up leaving defenses down.
Woken up in the middle of the night wasn't able to fall back asleep til pretty early in the morning.

Well like I said I broke up with my now ex so I'm living with a friend and her husband until I can afford to move out. I don't have any friends around and not many friends I see. Plus I don't have a car and live on the outskirts of West Lafayette so I hardly get out. I feel so alone :(
I thought about how alone and helpless I feel.
Hospital
I'm stressed right nowüò£

Depressed
He said im being unreasonable
I was feeling insecure about myself. Like he loves her and not me. I then caught him crying in bed about her.
He doesn't love me. If he loved me and was happy with me it wouldnt bother him that he's not with her anymore. He'd want all that with me and be happy that we can have that

Talking to you
Had a busy weekend and mikko hurt his leg before Xmas and I thought he was OK and he's possibly got a broke leg and I feel awful... Add that to the vet bill and its more debt and financial worry.
We discovered mikkos leg was worse than we thought we called the vet and they said if we couldn't pay we may need to discuss other options... That's not happening... And then we heard the vet estimate and we had to run to mo again
It was okay but stressful and emotional
Just the stuff with mikko earlier but I think I've dealt with it and I am coping okay just now.
Mikko had his xray and I'm really worried about the result he may need a major operation I can't afford or cancer or best case scenario he will be lame forever... I feel horrible

Break up
My aunt is here in the house visiting with me and Melina. When I am feeling nervous I get frozen in my head and start to worry about all kinds of things mainly about Melina being unhappy and wanting to leave me and this situation. The worrying makes it difficult to socialise and unite them in easy conversation so it makes me feel even more anxious that I'm not doing it right.
I woke up and knew it was time to get up as Melina told me so I felt sad that it was time to get up as I would have to deal with the day and felt like I had made Melina uncomfortable with the situation. Felt like I wouldn't be able to succeed at this social dance.
Maybe got into a university?

Yesterday I read up on Neuroticism. And that is me. Yeah well I was anxious to begin with and now I really am defect.
"Well I was doing quite rough since the revelation that I am neurotic. But when I came home I realized I was also introvert and not so much now. So I can change. And I found in the internet that I am also conscientious. Which is a big plus since I don't just duck and hide. And I have done a lot of soul work and basically that is exactly what I need to keep doing and retraining my thoughts to stay positive.
The problem is that it happens so ultra fast and I am crying before I know it.
Then I got the assignment for the seminar and immediately felt! Hey! I realize I felt!!! That's good news. Anyway I felt my windpipe being choked off.
Yeah so a feeling of death is near"
Well I am frustrated of course since I am so quick to feel threatened. And would like to work on it again with you.

Im sad. I dont have custody of my nineyear old
I spoke to Caity every night
Working hard
I'm having a panic attack
Can I just talk without judgement? Honestly?
I felt bad because my parents made me feel shame for the good things in my life and like I didn't know the value of money. Thus whenever there was a situation where I could depend on them I rejected it. Because I thought it was wrong. Whenever someone alluded to the fact that I was helped financially by my parents I panicked. Because the time when I was 100% financially dependent of my parents was when I was in the middle of abuse and wanting to kill myself.
My friend is not talking to me
"My mind has been upgraded so I can see outside the pyramid of reality.

What?
My parents don't care about me I am worthless
I am ill fated..
That I couldn't succeed and I was assaulted in my childhood and my parents don't care about me much and I don't have anyone to share my feelings and console me
I lost My grandma and i noticed i'm not Very liked by other people
Steven telling me I wasn't Zoey and that he wanted Zoey and that I wasn't his baby. Then he repeatedly beat me and threatened me until I did what he wanted me to do. When I woke up he asked me questions and I didn't answer them really. He asked what happened and said he remembered calling me Zoey but nothing else. He asked me why I was shaking and crying and then forced my head down to his dick and plugged my nose so I would open my mouth and he started fucking my mouth. I didn't realize crying and not wanting to do sexual things with him would turn him on like it did because the harder I cried from the pain from his beating me last night and the flashbacks and stress and feelings of worthlessness seemed to make him harder than I have ever felt him. He asked if I wanted to have a baby with him if we could have sex if I was okay if he could come in me and other questions and I shook my head no to them all but he took my clothes off and put himself in me anyways and held me so I couldn't get away and no matter how hard I pushed away from him and struggled against him in order to get him out of me he just held me that much tighter and fucked me that much harder. And when I realized I wasn't going to get out of it I felt that switch in my head of when there is no way to stop the rape click on and I went completely limp and just let him have his way and my body and brain shutdown. Once again I was watching myself from the ceiling of my bedroom as if I was just watching a movie. I am still in pain from him going so deep and being so hard. And I have no clue what I am going to do.
Start of uni
"I feel myself useless and hopeless
Nobody needs me I feel like I'm lost"
Everything was fine
Feel myself tired
I need to focus more on the present. For that I have deleted social media. Hoping to use the time I'd spend scrolling to reflect on self and be a present person.
A feeling of being judged
Hectic schedule
Parent student and employee
Anxious
Watching videos and trying to figure things out
My boyfriend is being toxic
I'm crying
Getting my brother tyler from school
People in school Tell me to kill My Self...what should i do (
They hitted me With a ruler...
My friend is having a really hard time and I feel her pain. I went through a similar thing a few years ago so I thought I'd be able to help...but her situation is not the same and I feel like nothing I say makes a difference. I'm worried about her.
They had thought that it was going to resolve itself. They thought that it would be ok. I thought that it would be okay.
i have a crush
I lost my virginty
Depression and moving house and pain
I just want to go to bed early
Stress at work
I was irritable with my wife
That I can't seem to help it
Yes
Hii wysa
Living with my partner and moving from his parents house
I went somewhere with lots of people
Break up
When I thought my boyfriend didn't want to be with me but he was just busy
That we were not spending  time together
Whatever I do I feel stressed.
I did a lot of work but it's still piling up
Weirdly okay
I am stressed even though I finished most of my things
I'm home and I don't know how to organise my time
Sleepy
I became many partner's carer
It's burger and fries
During my driving lessons
When I can't concentrate enough or learn quick enough
We're going out soon to pick up Brian's repaired bike
I am going to have an early night
Good day but very drained
Break up
Had a bad night
A girl in my praxis has very bad parents. It makes me helpless because I can't help her.
That I can't help her
my ex is treating me really badly
Me and my use to be bestie are not friends
Scared
I thought about what might happen
Moving to another country
I just feel tired most of the time. I have to sleep more than 9 hours to get rest
It is late now so I think it could be normal
I heart that my flat mate said that I must do more in the house. And I got a message from my father. He tries to contact me so often and hopes probably that the rest of family will forget how abusive he has been. I don't like his messages even when he says something nice
Today I'm not feeling motivated as this days...i feel low for no reason
I had a bad dream
I'm so overwhelmed
My kids are going crazy everything in the house is breaking I miss jose
I feel sad
I don't know why I keep trying with him. He's an asshole and only leaves me feeling down and broken.
I thought I'd send a nice picture
I just keep going back to him and I don't know why haha.
I just keep thinking it'll be like before but it's not and I'm finding it impossible to move on
I sent him pics and I thought he'd like it which was stupid I'm always looking for his approval and shit
Some family members have died and I wanted a friend that is always around.
When I get confused over something but everybody around me gets what is going on.
I berate myself for not knowing and then get upset at how silly I was being.
"I""m going to bed"
Working more
I felt really tired after a meeting
We had a lot of problems at work and I got scared one time because I feared an escalation but luckily both my boss and my husband reassured me about this. All the same I am a bit nervous about tomorrow
i'm feeling stressed because i have an exam tomorrow
A break up  an family issues
I'm aggitated
I've made a big mistake at work
I spoke to my boss about spmething I thought was wrong
Change of home and job
My anxiety my depression and the voices in my head.
A break up
Nothing. Nothing has changed. That's my problem
I'm actually pretty anxious and I often have panic attacks and that really stress me
I am not happy. It makes me sad that I don't have anyone to make happy anymore because that always made me happy aswell
I was talking to my friend that I really like
I really want to work or do something that I like but I actually don't know what to do! It makes me kinda sad
I saw things that I really want but I can't buy them because I don't have a proper work
People think that I complain a lot and that's not good
Well what I am experiencing is not having any major changes
I just don't have a lot of motivation right now and I'm trying to figure out where it went? Alcohol this weekend probably didn't help
I drank a lot
I have test tomorrow and also a speech interview I haven't practiced for which makes me super nervous
I'm feeling down
I'm unable to ever connect with people therefore being alone forever.
My basketball team hates mr
They hate me. They think I'm not a valuable member of their team. When somebody had to go to the other team they all said me and then push me forward because I totally didn't bring anything to their team. They always tell me to go and do better and just be better because then we'll do a lot better because I'm just totally horrible at basketball and honestly I'm really not.
They all hate me and didn't even bother to hide it
ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ
The anniversary of my dad's death is this week and the emotions connected to this day are overwhelming.
I just woke up
Depression
I moved abroad
It's late.  I was planning to go to bed earlier but my flatmates had a party and I was too anxious to join or to tell them to be quiet.
Getting a new job
Work
Work family deaths
I get tired a lot even if I haven‚Äôt done a lot of things during the day
I feel like a failure. I have no job despite graduating 2 years ago. I tried taking an exam for a job but I already failed three times. I've gotten to the point where I stopped caring about things. With every day I grow older the more of a disappointment I'm becoming. Especially to my family. Especially to my mother. I don't want to be like this anymore.
A cascade of my inner thoughts reminding myself of my own dissatisfaction and need to change.
Sorry
I couldn't sleep well
I felt too anxious to talk
Moving
I can't get out of bed
My inability to do simple things
I recently got broken hearted :(
I'm at work
I read something about my rapist a few hours ago..and even though i am aware that it s been a long time since it happened...idk why i still go back to these articles... and as i read it...it was really descriptive... something weird happened
Getting a Job
Someone hurt me and I didn't think things would ever get better
i think it was some kind of flash back
The article i read..
"the ""flashback"""
Hmm not sure if that is helping
This sounds awful complicated
Graduating
A lot of times I feel as though I'm not smart enough to reach certain goals and I'm not smart at all
That it seemed true to me
I started thinking that I made a wrong choice when I was choosing high schools
I felt threatened by my ex because we exchanged some private messages and I think he exposed them.
Not being able to go back in time and stop myself from doing that.
Like what?
Emm
Oh sorry about that.
I was crazy in love with a person. And that made me really happy. But I was shattered when he betrayed me. And told me to stop chasing after him.

I just feel so tearful and fed up with work. I got some negative feedback which I feel is unjust and I‚Äôm worries about what will happen about that. Not least I feel I need to talk it through with the person who gave the feedback but I don‚Äôt think I can hold things together right now and that will be seen as unprofessional
I had been struggling with the workload and reported it. I was told that I was doing fine and the problem was the unreasonable workload

So... I went through depression few years back and there was a guy who helped me overcome that made me believe in a lot of things again... And he did claim to love me and did his part.... Now suddenly a few weeks back I figure out on social media suddenly that he got engaged hours back..... Although he still says that he loves me but is getting married cause of his family

I was made to clean up used glasswares defrost freezers clear rubbish and deliver items that were not mine. For the past 2 years i was scolded blamed and criticised for things that i did not do errors that i did not commit. And recently i was told that i was a labour exchange for another company which my boss couldn't compensate.
I'm working on my master's degree
I feel very very sad...i am just so incompetent. My parents must have been so disappointed with me.

I've been trying really hard to recover from psychological trauma that has been having physical symptoms and that's been really hard to deal with since I lost my job and ended up in a wheelchair for nearly two months. And now I've been searching really hard for jobs and I no one will call me back. And I feel like I'm failing my fiance because I can't hold up my side of the bills in the house.
That I'm failing my fiance
I'm having trouble sleeping
I hate how he emotionally cheats

My mom
Most of my family and friends don't seem to listen when I talk to them. Like when I tell them stories or things I'm interested in. I get frustrated with my mom because she doesn't want to do anything and I end up taking care of her.
Job
I would feel my value decrease based on someones inability to see my worth.
The fact that me and my boyfriend were so close together and then all of a sudden he became distant . He changed acted different and he started making me feel jealous because he didn't care about me as much as i thought he did because we stopped talking less

You really want a cebuana
I'm sick of people at work not really doing much and I feel that it mostly falls to me to get the job done.
I feel that I'm going to be blamed for work not getting done as people would rather game the system to not do much work than actually doing their job and helping the team.
I am going to be working a 12 day week while others get to have a weekend off at the end of this week. Those same people are complaining about the work they have to do this week even though it is far less than what I have to do.

I'm trying to do too much
Well so at school this girl eman was being nasty to me she was shipping me with people but I obviously don't like and being a real butthead and she's all like lying about things like she's like there was this kid in Elementary School and he made up the stupid rumor about me and she brought it up again and I got so mad like I can't even like describe how mad I was and she's telling these lies in front of a bunch of people that I'm not friends with but are in my class and I don't care necessarily what they think like I tell myself not to care but like somewhere deep down I know I care a tiny bit even though I hate half of them or like them or I don't even know them
All through Elementary School she was really rude to me she was always like hanging out with like what used to be the cool kids until well our class was like for girls by the time we graduated great 6 and so she's all like I'm so cool I'm just going to make up rumors about you just because I don't like you because I was one of the popular which ones like there were two popular ones like there were two groups in my school there were the popular ones that were nasty and there was the popular ones that went up to people and hugged them or like hung out with a younger kids or like just talked to the people that hugs the younger kids and volunteered for kindergarten helpers and she was not one of those people like she was nasty and so she she was just so rude and she stole and lost one of my favorite rocks that I collected in grade 3 and she she she was nasty bully pretty much in grade 4 but not to me like she believed people like my friends are like little kids or she was just plain nasty
She also talked back to teachers but not in the way I did it was like she was purposely trying to like bring them off their pedestal I was just trying to defend myself like I defend myself I'm a defensive person and she's always like such a nasty person she took a photo of me today next to someone and that's who she started shipping me with then she started shipping me with other people and you know what's strange she didn't ship me with the person I like she who's in the glass she ships me with someone I don't even know I don't even like it's just like some random person that I happen to know the name of and I have to run to follow on Instagram and it's a load of crap and I just hate it I just want to finish Middle School Passing which is really hard when I'm severely sleep deprived and I sleep through every alarm I can't even fall asleep every night and not to mention the fact that like nobody listens to me like my best friend she got her group video games there an amazing musicals
And I watched one of those musicals and I liked it and so I tried to talk about it with her and she's been bugging me for weeks months even to watch it and the second I do she she she doesn't care I try to talk to her about it and I'm like hey the part where this person dies I so didn't see that coming or you know and she's all like her boyfriend and her friends and stuff and she doesn't even talk to me
She doesn't hesitate to call me out for interrupting a conversation but the second the second she has anything to say to me she interrupt whatever I'm doing and I've had enough of it like I literally have considered cutting around in my life but she's my best friend she's one of my only good friends because I have like zero friends that are actually like a good good friends and I want to stay friends with her forever but people believe her because she's a bit overweight and she's everyone like treats me like some kind of weirdo whenever they're talking about or because they call her fat and then I'm like no she isn't because she's my best friend and I defend my best friend right but she doesn't sink to defend me when someone
Insults me and I'm like you know what just whatever I just considered not being friends with her so many times but she's my best friend I defend her and really mad is she doesn't defend me but I enjoy talking to her when we're alone like when we go to McDonald's or the Damned alone or we go to the library alone or we hang out at my house or her house or somewhere else I just like that but I hate her friend like specifically her friends they say they're my friends but they're not my friends I didn't make those friends I didn't choose to be with friends sort of friends but they are not my friend
I don't know I have so many problems in my life and I just want to get one thing straight I am working so hard to plan for high school so I can get my style ready so I can organize my tablet so I can finish my favorite shows so that before high school I have nothing affecting me I want to read more I want to I want to decorate my I want to redecorate my room and like rearranged everything and repaint and go shopping for new clothes and just reinvent myself I've already reinvent myself but they keep their so mean I have to be so mean to hang out with them like I have to be like
So mean though like I mean you at don't even know how mean I have to be I have to insult people I have to laugh and the thing is it's a toxic relationship but it's my toxic relationship I can't get rid of my only friendship really like I live off my friendships the few friendships that I actually closely have I mean every time I talk to someone but my best friend I feel like they're judging me some way but she doesn't judge me she's just changed since grade school and I don't want to not be her friend but I don't want to be dragged down into the geek world just because she can't get a hold of herself she didn't used to like geeky stuff like oh I like video games like this and this and this and this she used to be like pink fluffy unicorns and it just makes me so mad because I'm laughing because I'm or I'm listening to music from my music or I'm watching her favorite show

My friend got a boyfriend on the 3rd then the next month my other friend got a boyfriend on the 3rd and I had to rush to find someone I liked by the 3rd. She is fantastic and I don't really regret asking her out but I don't know what to talk about around her because I don't know her all that well? I've been feeling really bad about doubting us because I know she loves me and we both had our first kiss the other day and I do care about her I just feel... unsure I guess? I'm worried I'll date her for a long time and be stuck with the only little bit of passion just enough for me to say I like her but I'm really worried my feelings won't grow
Oof I guess this situation doesn't really fit with your coding/programming or whatever
